# Shader Emitters Code Review Checklist

**Read `REVIEW_COMMON.md` (repo root) first - its contract binds this checklist.** Architecture
docs: `dasMetal/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `dasSpirv/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `dasSpirv/ARCHITECTURE_COOPMAT.md`.

**Never put anything that cannot compile on the CPU into a kernel body or into a function a
kernel calls - keep both in ordinary das.** A kernel built from ordinary values is compared
against its own CPU run; a marker struct - one that stands on the CPU for a value whose storage
exists only on the device (a tile, a tensor, a layout or view over one, a sampler, an image) and
has no storage of its own - and the builtins over it compile on the CPU, and their CPU bodies
compute nothing.

**A diff that adds or changes an emitter builtin whose operands are all ordinary CPU values - a
declaration in `daslib/shader_lingua_franca.das`, `dasSpirv/spirv/spirv_builtins.das` or
`dasMetal/metal/metal_builtins.das` - ships a CPU body that returns what the emitted form
returns, argument for argument.**

**A diff that changes what an emitter lowers - `dasSpirv`'s or `dasMetal`'s emit code - never
lets a construct the emitter cannot lower produce a kernel or a crash - the emitter reports a
compile error that names the construct instead.**

**Never pass a shape constant to a kernel as a runtime argument where a call-site constant can
carry it - pass it as a call-site constant.** A shape constant is a value that sizes a
`@workgroup` array, fixes an unrolled loop's trip count, or multiplies an index as a stride into a
fixed-extent array (a `@workgroup` or local array, not an ssbo the host sizes); a run-time count
of live entries inside such a fixed extent is not one. A call-site constant is fixed where the
kernel's source is generated - a template constant or a typedef - so the emitter bakes it in; a
kernel whose source is generated once and dispatched for differently shaped inputs cannot carry
a shape that varies per input that way.

**A SPIR-V kernel that loads its operands with `coopmatLoadTensor*` and takes a run-time-only
matmul reduction width takes it through a `tensorLayout2D` or `tensorLayout2DPad` whose
dimension `tensorLayoutSetDimension` sets; the load never reads the width from anywhere else -
only the accumulation loop's bound may read it from the push constants.** The reduction width is
the K dimension - the length of the loop the kernel accumulates over; it does not fix tiling, so
it is not a shape constant.

**A Metal kernel that loads its operands with the `tmm2d_*` family and takes a run-time-only
matmul reduction width takes it through a `matmul2d_descriptor` whose K extent is
`dynamic_extent`; the load never reads the width from anywhere else - only the accumulation
loop's bound may read it from the kernel's arguments.** The per-step chunk a `tmm2d_*` call takes
is a shape constant.

**A diff that makes a kernel need a shape constant known only at run time ships a
specialization path - one compiled variant per constant shape - or records the kernel as having
none in an `ARCHITECTURE*.md` at the root of the module it ships in.**

**A diff that claims an emitted shape value - in a commit message, a PR body, or an architecture
line - reads it from the emitted artifact, never from the das source, and states in its PR body
which artifact was read, the SPIR-V words `dasSpirv` builds or the MSL text `dasMetal` writes, and
the count or value read there.** Emitted shape is the structure of the emitted kernel - its
signature, its parameter attributes and binding numbers, its statement forms - and the constants
that structure carries: a tile, an unroll width, a SPIR-V kernel's local size (the `LocalSize`
execution mode the SPIR-V words carry), the extent of a local or `@workgroup` array. A grid is not
one, and neither is a Metal threadgroup size - both are dispatch arguments, read at the encoder
call site.

**A diff that adds a kernel-model capability to one emitter adds it to the other, or leaves the
shared ledger (`dasMetal/ARCHITECTURE.md#kernel-model-asymmetry-ledger`) naming that
capability - covered by the row that names its family, or by a row the diff adds.** A
kernel-model capability is present on an emitter when the emitted text or words carry its effect -
an emitter that accepts the construct and emits nothing for it does not have it - and a family is
the set of constructs one ledger row names.

**A diff that puts a `daslib/shader_lingua_franca` declaration into a kernel body or fixture an
emitter compiles, where that emitter does not handle it, ships, in the same change, either
that emitter's lowering of the declaration or a test showing the emitter rejects the
declaration by name.** A declaration in that module is available to both emitters.

**Weakening the MSL emitter's refusal to compile an unlicensed float `matmul2d` A operand -
`[metal_kernel(float_a_ok=true)]` is the license (`dasMetal/metal/msl_emit.das`) - is a defect.**
A float operand keeps the op off its native fast path.

**A diff that adds a global-rooted-array read - a module global, a `@workgroup` array or a
`self.<member>` resource read in a kernel body or a `def` it calls - or moves one to a new index,
past a condition that kept it out, or into a compiled `[spirv_kernel]`, `[compute_shader]` or
`[metal_kernel]` variant it was not in (a removed gate or a widened gate constant), or changes
the bound a dispatch hands that kernel or the size the read's buffer is allocated at, keeps the
read's index inside the region the buffer's sizing site allocates for that dispatch - the dispatch's own
bound is not that region - or inside slack, an allocation past the region's end that the
kernel's module-root `ARCHITECTURE*.md` names.** A guard on the read, a clamp into the region, a
guard on the store of a block the read loads whole, and a `static_if` or `@template_gate` that
compiles the read out of a variant each keep a read out.
