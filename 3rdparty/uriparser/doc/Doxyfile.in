# Project related options
###############################################################


PROJECT_NAME = "uriparser"
# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by double-quotes) that should identify the project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the title of most generated pages and in a few other places.


PROJECT_NUMBER = "@PROJECT_VERSION@"
# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version control system is used.


CHM_FILE = "..\@PROJECT_NAME@-@PROJECT_VERSION@.chm"
# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the CHM_FILE tag can be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm file. You can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be written to the html output directory.


OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = .
# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.


# CREATE_SUBDIRS = 
# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would otherwise causes performance problems for the file system.


# OUTPUT_LANGUAGE = 
# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all documentation generated by doxygen is written. Doxygen will use this information to generate all constant output in the proper language. The default language is English, other supported languages are: Afrikaans, Arabic, Brazilian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian.


# USE_WINDOWS_ENCODING = 
# This tag can be used to specify the encoding used in the generated output. The encoding is not always determined by the language that is chosen, but also whether or not the output is meant for Windows or non-Windows users. In case there is a difference, setting the USE_WINDOWS_ENCODING tag to YES forces the Windows encoding, (this is the default for the Windows binary), whereas setting the tag to NO uses a Unix-style encoding (the default for all platforms other than Windows).


# BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC = 
# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). Set to NO to disable this.


# REPEAT_BRIEF = 
# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will prepend the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description
#
# Note:
# If both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.


# ABBREVIATE_BRIEF = 
# This tag implements a quasi-intelligent brief description abbreviator that is used to form the text in various listings. Each string in this list, if found as the leading text of the brief description, will be stripped from the text and the result after processing the whole list, is used as the annotated text. Otherwise, the brief description is used as-is. If left blank, the following values are used ("\$name" is automatically replaced with the name of the entity): "The $name class" "The $name widget" "The $name file" "is" "provides" "specifies" "contains" "represents" "a" "an" "the".


# ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC = 
# If the ALWAYS_DETAILED_SEC and REPEAT_BRIEF tags are both set to YES then doxygen will generate a detailed section even if there is only a brief description.


# INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB = 
# If the INLINE_INHERITED_MEMB tag is set to YES, doxygen will show all inherited members of a class in the documentation of that class as if those members were ordinary class members. Constructors, destructors and assignment operators of the base classes will not be shown.


FULL_PATH_NAMES = NO
# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES doxygen will prepend the full path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used


# STRIP_FROM_PATH = 
# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then the STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path. Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list. If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to strip.


# STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH = 
# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should specify the include paths that are normally passed to the compiler using the -I flag.


# CASE_SENSE_NAMES = 
# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file names in lower-case letters. If set to YES upper-case letters are also allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows users are advised to set this option to NO.


# SHORT_NAMES = 
# If the SHORT_NAMES tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate much shorter (but less readable) file names. This can be useful is your file systems doesn't support long names like on DOS, Mac, or CD-ROM.


# JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF = 
# If the JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF is set to YES then doxygen will interpret the first line (until the first dot) of a JavaDoc-style comment as the brief description. If set to NO (the default), the Javadoc-style will behave just like the Qt-style comments.


BUILTIN_STL_SUPPORT = NO
# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string); v.s. func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.


# DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC = 
# If member grouping is used in the documentation and the DISTRIBUTE_GROUP_DOC tag is set to YES, then doxygen will reuse the documentation of the first member in the group (if any) for the other members of the group. By default all members of a group must be documented explicitly.


# MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = 
# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour. The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead. Note that setting this tag to YES also means that rational rose comments are not recognized any more.


# INHERIT_DOCS = 
# If the INHERIT_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then an undocumented member inherits the documentation from any documented member that it re-implements.


# SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES = 
# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES, then doxygen will produce a new page for each member. If set to NO, the documentation of a member will be part of the file/class/namespace that contains it.


# TAB_SIZE = 
# the TAB_SIZE tag can be used to set the number of spaces in a tab. Doxygen uses this value to replace tabs by spaces in code fragments.


# ALIASES = 
# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that acts as commands in the documentation. An alias has the form
#
# name=value
#
# For example adding
#
# "sideeffect=\par Side Effects:\n" 
#
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert newlines.


OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C = YES
# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all members will be omitted, etc.


# OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA = 
# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_JAVA tag to YES if your project consists of Java or Python sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for that language. For instance, namespaces will be presented as packages, qualified scopes will look different, etc.


# SUBGROUPING = 
# Set the SUBGROUPING tag to YES (the default) to allow class member groups of the same type (for instance a group of public functions) to be put as a subgroup of that type (e.g. under the Public Functions section). Set it to NO to prevent subgrouping. Alternatively, this can be done per class using the \nosubgrouping command.




###############################################################
# Build related options
###############################################################


EXTRACT_ALL = NO
# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES doxygen will assume all entities in documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private class members and static file members will be hidden unless the EXTRACT_PRIVATE and EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES
#
# Note:
# This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES 


EXTRACT_PRIVATE = YES
# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class will be included in the documentation.


EXTRACT_STATIC = YES
# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file will be included in the documentation.


# EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES = 
# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) defined locally in source files will be included in the documentation. If set to NO only classes defined in header files are included. Does not have any effect for Java sources.


# EXTRACT_LOCAL_METHODS = 
# This flag is only useful for Objective-C code. When set to YES local methods, which are defined in the implementation section but not in the interface are included in the documentation. If set to NO (the default) only methods in the interface are included.


HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS = NO
# If the HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all undocumented members inside documented classes or files. If set to NO (the default) these members will be included in the various overviews, but no documentation section is generated. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.


HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSES = NO
# If the HIDE_UNDOC_CLASSESS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide all undocumented classes. If set to NO (the default) these classes will be included in the various overviews. This option has no effect if EXTRACT_ALL is enabled.


HIDE_FRIEND_COMPOUNDS = NO
# If the HIDE_FRIEND_COMPOUNDS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide all friend (class|struct|union) declarations. If set to NO (the default) these declarations will be included in the documentation.


# HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS = 
# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide any documentation blocks found inside the body of a function. If set to NO (the default) these blocks will be appended to the function's detailed documentation block.


# INTERNAL_DOCS = 
# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded. Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.


HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES = YES
# If the HIDE_SCOPE_NAMES tag is set to NO (the default) then doxygen will show members with their full class and namespace scopes in the documentation. If set to YES the scope will be hidden.


SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES = YES
# If the SHOW_INCLUDE_FILES tag is set to YES (the default) then doxygen will put a list of the files that are included by a file in the documentation of that file.


# INLINE_INFO = 
# If the INLINE_INFO tag is set to YES (the default) then a tag [inline] is inserted in the documentation for inline members.


# SORT_MEMBER_DOCS = 
# If the SORT_MEMBER_DOCS tag is set to YES (the default) then doxygen will sort the (detailed) documentation of file and class members alphabetically by member name. If set to NO the members will appear in declaration order.


# SORT_BRIEF_DOCS = 
# If the SORT_BRIEF_DOCS tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the brief descriptions of file, namespace and class members alphabetically by member name. If set to NO (the default) the members will appear in declaration order.


# GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST = 
# The GENERATE_DEPRECATEDLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the deprecated list. This list is created by putting \deprecated commands in the documentation.


# GENERATE_TODOLIST = 
# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the todo list. This list is created by putting \todo commands in the documentation.


# GENERATE_TESTLIST = 
# The GENERATE_TESTLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the test list. This list is created by putting \test commands in the documentation.


# GENERATE_BUGLIST = 
# The GENERATE_BUGLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the bug list. This list is created by putting \bug commands in the documentation.


# ENABLED_SECTIONS = 
# The ENABLED_SECTIONS tag can be used to enable conditional documentation sections, marked by \if <section-label> ... \endif and \cond <section-label> ... \endcond blocks.


# MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES = 
# The MAX_INITIALIZER_LINES tag determines the maximum number of lines that the initial value of a variable or define can be. If the initializer consists of more lines than specified here it will be hidden. Use a value of 0 to hide initializers completely. The appearance of the value of individual variables and defines can be controlled using \showinitializer or \hideinitializer command in the documentation.


SHOW_USED_FILES = YES
# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated at the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.




###############################################################
# Options related to warning and progress messages
###############################################################


QUIET = YES
# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to standard output by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO, where YES implies that the messages are off. If left blank NO is used.


# WARNINGS = 
# The WARNINGS tag can be used to turn on/off the warning messages that are generated to standard error by doxygen. Possible values are YES and NO, where YES implies that the warnings are on. If left blank NO is used.
#
# Tip: Turn warnings on while writing the documentation.


WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED = YES
# If WARN_IF_UNDOCUMENTED is set to YES, then doxygen will generate warnings for undocumented members. If EXTRACT_ALL is set to YES then this flag will automatically be disabled.


WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR = YES
# If WARN_IF_DOC_ERROR is set to YES, doxygen will generate warnings for potential errors in the documentation, such as not documenting some parameters in a documented function, or documenting parameters that don't exist or using markup commands wrongly.


WARN_NO_PARAMDOC = YES
# This WARN_NO_PARAMDOC option can be abled to get warnings for functions that are documented, but have no documentation for their parameters or return value. If set to NO (the default) doxygen will only warn about wrong or incomplete parameter documentation, but not about the absence of documentation.


WARN_FORMAT = "WARNING: $text ($line, $file)"
# The WARN_FORMAT tag determines the format of the warning messages that doxygen can produce. The string should contain the $file, $line, and $text tags, which will be replaced by the file and line number from which the warning originated and the warning text.


# WARN_LOGFILE = 
# The WARN_LOGFILE tag can be used to specify a file to which warning and error messages should be written. If left blank the output is written to stderr.




###############################################################
# Input related options
###############################################################


INPUT = @CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/include @CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/doc/Mainpage.txt
# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with spaces.
#
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.


# FILE_PATTERNS = 
# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns (like *.cpp and *.h ) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank the following patterns are tested: .c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx *.hpp .h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm


# FILE_VERSION_FILTER = 
# The FILE_VERSION_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program or script that doxygen should invoke to get the current version for each file (typically from the version control system). Doxygen will invoke the program by executing (via popen()) the command command input-file, where command is the value of the FILE_VERSION_FILTER tag, and input-file is the name of an input file provided by doxygen. Whatever the program writes to standard output is used as the file version.
#
# Example of using a shell script as a filter for Unix:
#
# FILE_VERSION_FILTER = "/bin/sh versionfilter.sh"
#
# Example shell script for CVS:
#
# #!/bin/sh
# cvs status $1 | sed -n 's/^[ \]*Working revision:[ \t]*\([0-9][0-9\.]*\).*/\1/p'
#
# Example shell script for Subversion:
#
# #!/bin/sh
# svn stat -v $1 | sed -n 's/^[ A-Z?\*|!]\{1,15\}/r/;s/ \{1,15\}/\/r/;s/ .*//p'
#
# Example filter for ClearCase:
#
# FILE_VERSION_INFO = "cleartool desc -fmt \%Vn"


RECURSIVE = YES
# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank NO is used.


# EXCLUDE = 
# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.


# EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS = 
# The EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS tag can be used select whether or not files or directories that are symbolic links (a Unix filesystem feature) are excluded from the input.


# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS = 
# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude certain files from those directories.

# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to exclude all test directories use the pattern */test/*


# EXAMPLE_PATH = 
# The EXAMPLE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories that contain example code fragments that are included (see the \include command in section \include).


# EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE = 
# If the EXAMPLE_RECURSIVE tag is set to YES then subdirectories will be searched for input files to be used with the \include or \dontinclude commands irrespective of the value of the RECURSIVE tag. Possible values are YES and NO. If left blank NO is used.


# EXAMPLE_PATTERNS = 
# If the value of the EXAMPLE_PATH tag contains directories, you can use the EXAMPLE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left blank all files are included.


# IMAGE_PATH = 
# The IMAGE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more files or directories that contain images that are to be included in the documentation (see the \image command).


INPUT_FILTER = "bash @CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/doc/preprocess.sh"
# The INPUT_FILTER tag can be used to specify a program that doxygen should invoke to filter for each input file. Doxygen will invoke the filter program by executing (via popen()) the command:
#
# <filter> <input-file>
#
# where <filter> is the value of the INPUT_FILTER tag, and <input-file> is the name of an input file. Doxygen will then use the output that the filter program writes to standard output.


# FILTER_PATTERNS = 
# The FILTER_PATTERNS tag can be used to specify filters on a per file pattern basis. Doxygen will compare the file name with each pattern and apply the filter if there is a match. The filters are a list of the form: pattern=filter (like *.cpp=my_cpp_filter). See INPUT_FILTER for further info on how filters are used. If FILTER_PATTERNS is empty, INPUT_FILTER is applied to all files.


# FILTER_SOURCE_FILES = 
# If the FILTER_SOURCE_FILES tag is set to YES, the input filter (if set using INPUT_FILTER ) will also be used to filter the input files that are used for producing the source files to browse (i.e. when SOURCE_BROWSER is set to YES).




###############################################################
# Source browsing related options
###############################################################


# SOURCE_BROWSER = 
# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be generated. Documented entities will be cross-referenced with these sources.


# INLINE_SOURCES = 
# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body of functions, classes and enums directly into the documentation.


STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS = YES
# Setting the STRIP_CODE_COMMENTS tag to YES (the default) will instruct doxygen to hide any special comment blocks from generated source code fragments. Normal C and C++ comments will always remain visible.


# REFERENCED_BY_RELATION = 
# If the REFERENCED_BY_RELATION tag is set to YES (the default) then for each documented function all documented functions referencing it will be listed.


# REFERENCES_RELATION = 
# If the REFERENCES_RELATION tag is set to YES (the default) then for each documented function all documented entities called/used by that function will be listed.


# REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = 
# If the REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE tag is set to YES (the default) and SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES, then the hyperlinks from functions in REFERENCES_RELATION and REFERENCED_BY_RELATION lists will link to the source code. Otherwise they will link to the documentstion.


VERBATIM_HEADERS = NO
# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set the YES (the default) then doxygen will generate a verbatim copy of the header file for each class for which an include is specified. Set to NO to disable this.
#
# See also:
# Section \class.


# USE_HTAGS = 
# If the USE_HTAGS tag is set to YES then the references to source code will point to the HTML generated by the htags(1) tool instead of doxygen built-in source browser. The htags tool is part of GNU's global source tagging system (see http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). The use it do the following:
#
# 1. Install the latest version of global (i.e. 4.8.6 or better)
# 2. Enable SOURCE_BROWSER and USE_HTAGS in the config file
# 3. Make sure the INPUT points to the root of the source tree
# 4. Run doxygen as normal
#
# Doxygen will invoke htags (and that will in turn invoke gtags), so these tools must be available from the command line (i.e. in the search path).
#
# The result: instead of the source browser generated by doxygen, the links to source code will now point to the output of htags.




###############################################################
# Alphabetical index options
###############################################################


# COLS_IN_ALPHA_INDEX = 
# If the alphabetical index is enabled (see ALPHABETICAL_INDEX) then the COLS_IN_ALPHA_INDEX tag can be used to specify the number of columns in which this list will be split (can be a number in the range [1..20])


# IGNORE_PREFIX = 
# In case all classes in a project start with a common prefix, all classes will be put under the same header in the alphabetical index. The IGNORE_PREFIX tag can be used to specify a prefix (or a list of prefixes) that should be ignored while generating the index headers.




###############################################################
# HTML related options
###############################################################


GENERATE_HTML = YES
# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will generate HTML output


# HTML_OUTPUT = TODO
# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put. If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.


# HTML_FILE_EXTENSION = 
# The HTML_FILE_EXTENSION tag can be used to specify the file extension for each generated HTML page (for example: .htm, .php, .asp). If it is left blank doxygen will generate files with .html extension.


# HTML_HEADER = TODO
# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML header file for each generated HTML page. To get valid HTML the header file should contain at least a <HTML> and a <BODY> tag, but it is good idea to include the style sheet that is generated by doxygen as well. Minimal example:
#
# <HTML>
# <HEAD>
# <TITLE>My title</TITLE>
# <LINK HREF="doxygen.css" REL="stylesheet" TYPE="text/css">
# </HEAD>
# <BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
#
# If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard header.
#
# The following commands have a special meaning inside the header: $title, $datetime, $date, $doxygenversion, $projectname, and $projectnumber. Doxygen will replace them by respectively the title of the page, the current date and time, only the current date, the version number of doxygen, the project name (see PROJECT_NAME), or the project number (see PROJECT_NUMBER).
#
# If CREATE_SUBDIRS is enabled, the command $relpath$ can be used to produce a relative path to the root of the HTML output directory, e.g. use $relpath$doxygen.css, to refer to the standard style sheet.
#
# See also section Doxygen usage for information on how to generate the default header that doxygen normally uses.


# HTML_FOOTER = 
# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a user-defined HTML footer for each generated HTML page. To get valid HTML the footer file should contain at least a </BODY> and a </HTML> tag. A minimal example:
#
# </BODY>
# </HTML>
#
# If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a standard footer.
#
# The following commands have a special meaning inside the footer: $title, $datetime, $date, $doxygenversion, $projectname, $projectnumber. Doxygen will replace them by respectively the title of the page, the current date and time, only the current date, the version number of doxygen, the project name (see PROJECT_NAME), or the project number (see PROJECT_NUMBER).
#
# See also section Doxygen usage for information on how to generate the default footer that doxygen normally uses.


# HTML_STYLESHEET = 
# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen will generate a default style sheet.
#
# See also section Doxygen usage for information on how to generate the style sheet that doxygen normally uses.


# HTML_ALIGN_MEMBERS = 
# If the HTML_ALIGN_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, the members of classes, files or namespaces will be aligned in HTML using tables. If set to NO a bullet list will be used.
#
# Note: Setting this tag to NO will become obsolete in the future, since I only intent to support and test the aligned representation.


GENERATE_HTMLHELP = @GENERATE_HTMLHELP@
# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES then doxygen generates three additional HTML index files: index.hhp, index.hhc, and index.hhk. The index.hhp is a project file that can be read by Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop on Windows.
#
# The HTML Help Workshop contains a compiler that can convert all HTML output generated by doxygen into a single compressed HTML file (.chm). Compressed HTML files are now used as the Windows 98 help format, and will replace the old Windows help format (.hlp) on all Windows platforms in the future. Compressed HTML files also contain an index, a table of contents, and you can search for words in the documentation. The HTML workshop also contains a viewer for compressed HTML files.


HHC_LOCATION = "@HTML_HELP_COMPILER@"
# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the HHC_LOCATION tag can be used to specify the location (absolute path including file name) of the HTML help compiler (hhc.exe). If non empty doxygen will try to run the HTML help compiler on the generated index.hhp.


# GENERATE_CHI = 
# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the GENERATE_CHI flag controls if a separate .chi index file is generated (YES) or that it should be included in the master .chm file (NO).


# BINARY_TOC = 
# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the BINARY_TOC flag controls whether a binary table of contents is generated (YES) or a normal table of contents (NO) in the .chm file.


# TOC_EXPAND = 
# The TOC_EXPAND flag can be set to YES to add extra items for group members to the table of contents of the HTML help documentation and to the tree view.


# DISABLE_INDEX = 
# If you want full control over the layout of the generated HTML pages it might be necessary to disable the index and replace it with your own. The DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index at top of each page. A value of NO (the default) enables the index and the value YES disables it.


# ENUM_VALUES_PER_LINE = 
# This tag can be used to set the number of enum values (range [1..20]) that doxygen will group on one line in the generated HTML documentation.


# GENERATE_TREEVIEW = 
# If the GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports JavaScript and frames is required (for instance Mozilla 1.0+, Netscape 6.0+ or Internet explorer 5.0+ or Konqueror).


# TREEVIEW_WIDTH = 
# If the treeview is enabled (see GENERATE_TREEVIEW) then this tag can be used to set the initial width (in pixels) of the frame in which the tree is shown.

# LaTeX related options
###############################################################


GENERATE_LATEX = NO
# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will generate $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ output.


# LATEX_OUTPUT = 
# The LATEX_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ docs will be put. If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of it. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default path.

# The LATEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the LaTeX command name to be invoked. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default command name.


# MAKEINDEX_CMD_NAME = 
# The MAKEINDEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the command name to generate index for LaTeX. If left blank `makeindex' will be used as the default command name.


# COMPACT_LATEX = 
# If the COMPACT_LATEX tag is set to YES doxygen generates more compact $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ documents. This may be useful for small projects and may help to save some trees in general.


# PAPER_TYPE = 
# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used by the printer. Possible values are:
#
# * a4 (210 x 297 mm).
# * a4wide (same as a4, but including the a4wide package).
# * letter (8.5 x 11 inches).
# * legal (8.5 x 14 inches).
# * executive (7.25 x 10.5 inches)
#
# If left blank a4wide will be used.


# EXTRA_PACKAGES = 
# The EXTRA_PACKAGES tag can be used to specify one or more $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ package names that should be included in the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ output. To get the times font for instance you can specify
#
# EXTRA_PACKAGES = times
#
# If left blank no extra packages will be included.


# LATEX_HEADER = 
# The LATEX_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ header for the generated $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ document. The header should contain everything until the first chapter.
#
# If it is left blank doxygen will generate a standard header. See section Doxygen usage for information on how to let doxygen write the default header to a separate file.
#
# Note:
# Only use a user-defined header if you know what you are doing!
#
# The following commands have a special meaning inside the header: $title, $datetime, $date, $doxygenversion, $projectname, $projectnumber. Doxygen will replace them by respectively the title of the page, the current date and time, only the current date, the version number of doxygen, the project name (see PROJECT_NAME), or the project number (see PROJECT_NUMBER).


# PDF_HYPERLINKS = 
# If the PDF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ that is generated is prepared for conversion to PDF (using ps2pdf or pdflatex). The PDF file will contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references. This makes the output suitable for online browsing using a PDF viewer.


# USE_PDFLATEX = 
# If the LATEX_PDFLATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will use pdflatex to generate the PDF file directly from the $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ files.


# LATEX_BATCHMODE = 
# If the LATEX_BATCHMODE tag is set to YES, doxygen will add the \batchmode. command to the generated $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ files. This will instruct $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ to keep running if errors occur, instead of asking the user for help. This option is also used when generating formulas in HTML.


# LATEX_HIDE_INDICES = 
# If LATEX_HIDE_INDICES is set to YES then doxygen will not include the index chapters (such as File Index, Compound Index, etc.) in the output.




###############################################################
# RTF related options
###############################################################


# GENERATE_RTF = 
# If the GENERATE_RTF tag is set to YES doxygen will generate RTF output. The RTF output is optimized for Word 97 and may not look too pretty with other readers/editors.


# RTF_OUTPUT = 
# The RTF_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the RTF docs will be put. If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of it. If left blank rtf will be used as the default path.


# COMPACT_RTF = 
# If the COMPACT_RTF tag is set to YES doxygen generates more compact RTF documents. This may be useful for small projects and may help to save some trees in general.


# RTF_HYPERLINKS = 
# If the RTF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the RTF that is generated will contain hyperlink fields. The RTF file will contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references. This makes the output suitable for online browsing using Word or some other Word compatible reader that support those fields.
#
# note:
# WordPad (write) and others do not support links.


# RTF_STYLESHEET_FILE = 
# Load stylesheet definitions from file. Syntax is similar to doxygen's config file, i.e. a series of assignments. You only have to provide replacements, missing definitions are set to their default value.
#
# See also section Doxygen usage for information on how to generate the default style sheet that doxygen normally uses.


# RTF_EXTENSIONS_FILE = 
# Set optional variables used in the generation of an RTF document. Syntax is similar to doxygen's config file. A template extensions file can be generated using doxygen -e rtf extensionFile.




###############################################################
# Man page related options
###############################################################


# GENERATE_MAN = 
# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will generate man pages for classes and files.


# MAN_OUTPUT = 
# The MAN_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the man pages will be put. If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of it. If left blank `man' will be used as the default path. A directory man3 will be created inside the directory specified by MAN_OUTPUT.


# MAN_EXTENSION = 
# The MAN_EXTENSION tag determines the extension that is added to the generated man pages (default is the subroutine's section .3)


# MAN_LINKS = 
# If the MAN_LINKS tag is set to YES and doxygen generates man output, then it will generate one additional man file for each entity documented in the real man page(s). These additional files only source the real man page, but without them the man command would be unable to find the correct page. The default is NO.




###############################################################
# XML related options
###############################################################


# GENERATE_XML = 
# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES Doxygen will generate an XML file that captures the structure of the code including all documentation.


# XML_OUTPUT = 
# The XML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the XML pages will be put. If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be put in front of it. If left blank xml will be used as the default path.


# XML_SCHEMA = 
# The XML_SCHEMA tag can be used to specify an XML schema, which can be used by a validating XML parser to check the syntax of the XML files.


# XML_DTD = 
# The XML_DTD tag can be used to specify an XML DTD, which can be used by a validating XML parser to check the syntax of the XML files.


# XML_PROGRAMLISTING = 
# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES Doxygen will dump the program listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size of the XML output.




###############################################################
# AUTOGEN_DEF related options
###############################################################


# GENERATE_AUTOGEN_DEF = 
# If the GENERATE_AUTOGEN_DEF tag is set to YES Doxygen will generate an AutoGen Definitions (see http://autogen.sf.net) file that captures the structure of the code including all documentation. Note that this feature is still experimental and incomplete at the moment.




###############################################################
# PERLMOD related options
###############################################################


# GENERATE_PERLMOD = 
# If the GENERATE_PERLMOD tag is set to YES Doxygen will generate a Perl module file that captures the structure of the code including all documentation. Note that this feature is still experimental and incomplete at the moment.


# PERLMOD_LATEX = 
# If the PERLMOD_LATEX tag is set to YES Doxygen will generate the necessary Makefile rules, Perl scripts and LaTeX code to be able to generate PDF and DVI output from the Perl module output.


# PERLMOD_PRETTY = 
# If the PERLMOD_PRETTY tag is set to YES the Perl module output will be nicely formatted so it can be parsed by a human reader. This is useful if you want to understand what is going on. On the other hand, if this tag is set to NO the size of the Perl module output will be much smaller and Perl will parse it just the same.


# PERLMOD_MAKEVAR_PREFIX = 
# The names of the make variables in the generated doxyrules.make file are prefixed with the string contained in PERLMOD_MAKEVAR_PREFIX. This is useful so different doxyrules.make files included by the same Makefile don't overwrite each other's variables.




###############################################################
# Preprocessor related options
###############################################################


ENABLE_PREPROCESSING = YES
# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will evaluate all C-preprocessor directives found in the sources and include files.


MACRO_EXPANSION = NO
# If the MACRO_EXPANSION tag is set to YES doxygen will expand all macro names in the source code. If set to NO (the default) only conditional compilation will be performed. Macro expansion can be done in a controlled way by setting EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF to YES.


EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF = NO
# If the EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF and MACRO_EXPANSION tags are both set to YES then the macro expansion is limited to the macros specified with the PREDEFINED and EXPAND_AS_DEFINED tags.


SEARCH_INCLUDES = YES
# If the SEARCH_INCLUDES tag is set to YES (the default) the includes files in the INCLUDE_PATH (see below) will be searched if a #include is found.


INCLUDE_PATH = @CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR@/include
# The INCLUDE_PATH tag can be used to specify one or more directories that contain include files that are not input files but should be processed by the preprocessor.


# PREDEFINED = 
# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1" is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.


# EXPAND_AS_DEFINED = 
# If the MACRO_EXPANSION and EXPAND_ONLY_PREDEF tags are set to YES then this tag can be used to specify a list of macro names that should be expanded. The macro definition that is found in the sources will be used. Use the PREDEFINED tag if you want to use a different macro definition.


# SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS = 
# If the SKIP_FUNCTION_MACROS tag is set to YES (the default) then doxygen's preprocessor will remove all function-like macros that are alone on a line, have an all uppercase name, and do not end with a semicolon. Such function macros are typically used for boiler-plate code, and will confuse the parser if not removed.




###############################################################
# External reference options
###############################################################


# TAGFILES = 
# The TAGFILES tag can be used to specify one or more tagfiles.
#
# See section Doxytag usage for more information about the usage of tag files.
#
# Optionally an initial location of the external documentation can be added for each tagfile. The format of a tag file without this location is as follows:
#
# TAGFILES = file1 file2 ... 
#
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows:
#
# TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ... 
#
# where loc1 and loc2 can be relative or absolute paths or URLs, If a location is present for each tag, the installdox tool (see section Installdox usage for more information) does not have to be run to correct the links.
#
# Note:
# Each tag file must have a unique name (where the name does not include the path) If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen is run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.


# GENERATE_TAGFILE = 
# When a file name is specified after GENERATE_TAGFILE, doxygen will create a tag file that is based on the input files it reads. See section Doxytag usage for more information about the usage of tag files.


# ALLEXTERNALS = 
# If the ALLEXTERNALS tag is set to YES all external class will be listed in the class index. If set to NO only the inherited external classes will be listed.


# EXTERNAL_GROUPS = 
# If the EXTERNAL_GROUPS tag is set to YES all external groups will be listed in the modules index. If set to NO, only the current project's groups will be listed.


# PERL_PATH = 
# The PERL_PATH should be the absolute path and name of the perl script interpreter (i.e. the result of `which perl').




###############################################################
# Dot options
###############################################################


# CLASS_DIAGRAMS = 
# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will generate a class diagram (in HTML and $\mbox{\LaTeX}$) for classes with base or super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off. Note that this option is superseded by the HAVE_DOT option below. This is only a fallback. It is recommended to install and use dot, since it yields more powerful graphs.


HAVE_DOT = YES
# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz, a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is set to NO (the default)


CLASS_GRAPH = NO
# If the CLASS_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and indirect inheritance relations. Setting this tag to YES will force the the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag to NO.


COLLABORATION_GRAPH = NO
# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and indirect implementation dependencies (inheritance, containment, and class references variables) of the class with other documented classes.


# GROUP_GRAPHS
# If the GROUP_GRAPHS and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for groups, showing the direct groups dependencies.


UML_LOOK = NO
# If the UML_LOOK tag is set to YES doxygen will generate inheritance and collaboration diagrams in a style similar to the OMG's Unified Modeling Language.


# TEMPLATE_RELATIONS = 
# If the TEMPLATE_RELATIONS and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will show the relations between templates and their instances.


HIDE_UNDOC_RELATIONS = NO
# If set to YES, the inheritance and collaboration graphs will hide inheritance and usage relations if the target is undocumented or is not a class.


INCLUDE_GRAPH = YES
# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING, SEARCH_INCLUDES, INCLUDE_GRAPH, and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented file showing the direct and indirect include dependencies of the file with other documented files.


INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH = YES
# If the ENABLE_PREPROCESSING, SEARCH_INCLUDES, INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH, and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented header file showing the documented files that directly or indirectly include this file.


CALL_GRAPH = NO
# If the CALL_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a call dependency graph for every global function or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs for selected functions only using the \callgraph command.


CALLER_GRAPH = NO
# If the CALLER_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will generate a caller dependency graph for every global function or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable caller graphs for selected functions only using the \callergraph command.


GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY = YES
# If the GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen will graphical hierarchy of all classes instead of a textual one.


# DIRECTORY_GRAPH
# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH, SHOW_DIRECTORIES and HAVE_DOT options are set to YES then doxygen will show the dependencies a directory has on other directories in a graphical way. The dependency relations are determined by the #include relations between the files in the directories.


# DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT = 
# The DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT tag can be used to set the image format of the images generated by dot. Possible values are gif, jpg, and png. If left blank png will be used.


# DOT_PATH = 
# This tag can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found on the path.


# DOTFILE_DIRS = 
# This tag can be used to specify one or more directories that contain dot files that are included in the documentation (see the \dotfile command).


# MAX_DOT_GRAPH_HEIGHT = 
# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_HEIGHT tag can be used to set the maximum allows height (in pixels) of the graphs generated by dot. If a graph becomes larger than this value, doxygen will try to truncate the graph, so that it fits within the specified constraint. Beware that most browsers cannot cope with very large images.


# MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH = 
# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the graphs generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable from the root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes that lay further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this option to 1 or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large code bases. Also note that a graph may be further truncated if the graph's image dimensions are not sufficient to fit the graph (see MAX_DOT_GRAPH_WIDTH and MAX_DOT_GRAPH_HEIGHT). If 0 is used for the depth value (the default), the graph is not depth-constraint.


# MAX_DOT_GRAPH_WIDTH = 
# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_WIDTH tag can be used to set the maximum allowed width (in pixels) of the graphs generated by dot. If a graph becomes larger than this value, doxygen will try to truncate the graph, so that it fits within the specified constraint. Beware that most browsers cannot cope with very large images.


# DOT_TRANSPARENT = 
# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent background. This is disabled by default, which results in a white background. Warning: Depending on the platform used, enabling this option may lead to badly anti-aliased labels on the edges of a graph (i.e. they become hard to read).


DOT_MULTI_TARGETS = YES
# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) support this, this feature is disabled by default.


GENERATE_LEGEND = YES
# If the GENERATE_LEGEND tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will generate a legend page explaining the meaning of the various boxes and arrows in the dot generated graphs.


# DOT_CLEANUP = 
# If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES (the default) doxygen will remove the intermediate dot files that are used to generate the various graphs.




###############################################################
# Search engine options
###############################################################


# SEARCHENGINE = 
# The SEARCHENGINE tag specifies whether or not the HTML output should contain a search facility. Possible values are YES and NO. If set to YES, doxygen will produce a search index and a PHP script to search through the index. For this to work the documentation should be viewed via a web-server running PHP version 4.1.0 or higher. (See http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php for installation instructions).
