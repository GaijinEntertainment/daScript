# Kernel generation — `[llvm_code]`, the tune framework, and GEMM — plan

**Status: architecture settled (2026-07-04 discussion), pre-implementation.** This supersedes
the GEMM-only first draft of this document. The GEMM generator is now the flagship *client*
of two generic dasLLVM capabilities — an external-codegen hook (`[llvm_code]`, part 1) and a
generalized tune framework (part 2) — with GEMM as part 3. Work order: **part 1 minimal →
M0–M2 evidence on the M1 Mac → parts 2–3 built on that evidence.** Companion docs:
`x64_arch.md` (the two x64 seams), `history/dasLLAMA/avx_kernel_matrix.md` (the hand-written tier matrix this
eventually deletes), `tune_for_this_box.md` (the tuner rail being generalized),
`history/dasLLAMA/epyc9654_measurements.md` (the motivating fleet evidence).

**Hardware plan (settled):** the M1 Mac first — this box's **sdot kernels** are the M0–M2
vehicle. Zen2 desktop after (avx2/maddubs perms; no VNNI). The EPYC 9654 is parked but
configured — wake it up only when everything is a win and there's a reason (zvnni perms,
fleet re-score). x64 emission work runs on the Mac via `DAS_JIT_X64_FORCE_FEATURES` + `llc`
disasm (never execute forced artifacts).

---

## The frame

Hand-writing kernels doesn't scale and never will: llama.cpp carries ~390 hand-written
kernels (~1000 ISA paths across 7 architectures, `arch/*/repack.cpp` + `ggml-cpu-quants.c`),
and every one of them is the same loop nest with different constants — tile shape, vector
width, dot primitive, repack layout, scale fold. That's not 390 kernels; it's **one
parametric family** and a maintenance moat. We stop digging our own copy of that moat:
generate the loop nest as LLVM IR, tune by sweeping the parameter space, and let per-ISA
support collapse to a per-ISA dot-primitive emitter.

**The gap it chases:** fleet prefill is uniformly ~0.73–0.86× of llama.cpp on Genoa
(gpt-oss 0.61×) after the zvnni batch pin; on M1 prefill median is 0.92× (their engine
there is Accelerate/AMX). Decode at ≥1B is already near-parity — this is a **batch-GEMM
(prefill) program** first.

**Risk framing (Boris):** generation-via-LLVM on the box you're sitting at is expected to
just work — IR is IR. The *cross-platform* portion (emitting for targets you can't execute)
is where the annoyance lives. So the GO/NO-GO is less "can it work" and more "does one
generated perm beat our best hand kernel on real silicon" (M2 below).

---

## The architecture — three parts

### Part 1 — `[llvm_code(...)]`: external codegen hook (dasLLVM core)

The generic extension point. An annotation on an ordinary das function:

```
[llvm_code(name = "module_name::generator_function", anyarg = anyvalue, other = whatever)]
def q8q8_batch_8x4(w : uint8 const?; ws : float const?; ...) {
    // reference body — bit-exact semantics; interp, AOT, and non-matching
    // JIT targets compile this verbatim
}
```

- **At JIT time**, instead of compiling the body, the JIT calls the named das **generator
  function**, passing the annotation arguments, the name of the function to generate, and
  the AST (the generator gets the `Function` — signature, types, everything it needs).
- **The generator lives in the llvm-jit context** (the JIT is a das program in its own
  context; a user-module `[init]` can't reach it — the annotation IS the channel). Module
  wiring for now: **`llvm_user_modules.das`** — a user-edited extra-require list in dasLLVM
  daslib. End state: `require ?gemm_kernels` optional-require, the linq-adapter pattern.
  No stronger machinery for now; fine as-is.
- **ABI via helper function**: the generator calls a helper to create the LLVM function
  declaration with the das JIT calling convention (lean: helper the generator opts into,
  not JIT-pre-created). This also gives the **decline path** — the generator returns false
  (wrong ISA, illegal perm) and the JIT compiles the reference body normally.
- **Correctness tiers for free:** the reference body is the AOT gate and the bit-exact
  oracle in one move — same rule as every intrinsic today (correct everywhere, fast where
  the emitter fires).
- **Cache keying: MANUAL for now** (`LLVM_JIT_CODEGEN_VERSION` bump discipline). Folding
  the generator function's hash + its dependency closure into the DLL key gets too big;
  revisit when it bites.
- Known-missing mechanics are accepted: make it work first; the shapes of the missing
  pieces become obvious in the process.

### Part 2 — the tune framework moves into dasLLVM (and generalizes)

The tune machinery (`dasllama_tune.das` — `[tuned]`/`[dasllama_grid]`) migrates to dasLLVM
and becomes the stub factory. Example: given `add(a?, b?, count)`, a **tune macro**
generates a family of named stubs — `add_vector`, `add_unroll`, `add_vec4_unroll2`, … —
each carrying `[llvm_code(name = "addunroller", ...)]` with different arguments.

**Three modes:**

| Mode | Stamping | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| **normal run** | manifest read; **exactly the winner** is stamped — one body per function, no runtime variant dispatch at all | the app |
| **tune run** | full grid stamped | profile all stubs (interleaved ABBA is native — all variants in one process beats the env-var A/B rail), write winners to the manifest |
| **test run** | full grid stamped | **bit-exact gate**: every stub vs the reference body, no timing — generator bugs die here, never in production |

**The manifest:**

- JSON, sits **next to the app**. Resolution per function: manifest entry > the annotation's
  `fallback=` perm > reference body — a manifest with no entry for a function falls through
  to its fallback (M4, Boris: a stale manifest written before a kernel family landed must not
  silently drop it to the reference tier); an explicit `"reference"` entry forces the
  original body.
- Keys are **function names** — the best persistent ID the language has (no GUIDs
  embeddable; "function's loop N" by index is fragile under edits but accepted).
- Values are stamping instructions: *"stamp this function with this macro with these
  arguments"* and *"stamp this function's loop N with these values"* — the second kind
  **subsumes today's `[tuned]` loop-hint rail**.
- APIs: set-a-value-to-manifest (used during tuning) and read-your-own-tune-value (used by
  the macro at stamp time).

**Client contract per kernel family:** the reference function, the perm grid, the generator
name, and a probe (representative shapes to bench and compare against the reference).

### Part 3 — GEMM kernels become tune-macro clients

The original plan's kernels, re-expressed: the GEMM family is a tune macro whose stubs
carry `[llvm_code]` perms. Per perm the generator targets **two functions** — the kernel
itself and **`get_repack_type`** — stamped from the same schema, so layout and kernel can
never desync (`needs_repack`/interleave factor derive from `mr`). Load-time repack just
calls the generated `get_repack_type`.

**End state:** delete every hand-written platform-specific kernel we've built so far (the
x64 AVX matrix tiers, the arm64 laneq/sdot tiers), `[tune]` the **big GEMM** and the
**small GEMM**, and live happily ever after. The `KernelBackend` registry shrinks to
slot-shaped call-site selection — decode-vs-batch per-slot hybrid still means distinct stub
functions per regime, but that's plain das call sites, not a runtime tier registry.

---

## Settled / deferred (the first draft's open questions)

1. **Schema surface — settled:** annotation-on-stub via the generic `[llvm_code]`; the
   *tune macro* stamps stubs (the callmacro idea landed at the tune layer, not the
   generator layer — the annotation stays the JIT surface).
2. **Sweep mechanics — settled:** all-stubs-in-one-tune-binary (one JIT compile sweeps the
   family); winners live in the JSON manifest; DLL cache keying manual for now.
3. **Per-model winners — DEFERRED.** Per-model may not make the cut at all; `bake = k` and
   per-slot perm pins get decided only after M2 numbers say whether baking shapes matters.
4. **Registration locality — settled:** `llvm_user_modules.das` user-edited require list
   now, `require ?module` optional-require later. Generators run in the llvm-jit context.
5. **Hardware — settled:** M1 first (sdot), Zen2 after (avx2/maddubs), EPYC wake-up when
   everything wins.

---

## The perm vector (the knobs)

The parameter space the generator must span — the M2 kernel is written against these names
so the schema is validated by use. The generator rejects illegal perms at emit time (vreg
budget AND per-ISA legality), which in tune terms means those stubs decline and are skipped.

| Knob | Values (initial) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dot` | `sdot` (NEON — **first**, the M1 leg), `vpdpbusd` (u8·s8 + sign trick), `maddubs` (VPMADDUBSW+VPMADDWD pair), `vpdpbssd` (VNNI-INT8, s8·s8 native), `mx4` (shuffle-dequant + dot) | per-ISA emitter; the sign-trick identity and its `|a|`-on-unsigned rule are in `x64_arch.md` |
| `width` | 128 (NEON q-regs), 256 (ymm), 512 (zmm) | zmm halves instruction count but watch frequency/port behavior per box — a *tuned* knob, not a derived one |
| `mr × nr` | e.g. 4×4, 8×4, 8×8, 16×4 (rows × tokens) | register-tile shape. Hard constraint: `mr·nr` accumulators + row loads + broadcast ≤ 32 vregs (16 for ymm) |
| `kstep` | 1, 2, 4 blocks (32 int8 = 1 block) per K-iteration | interacts with `acc` promotion; full unroll when K is baked (per-model — deferred) |
| `repack` | `none` (row-major), `grp<mr>` (mr-row block interleave, scales interleaved) | **interleave factor derives from `mr`** — `get_repack_type` is generated from the same perm |
| `acc` | `i32reg` (mr·nr i32 vreg tile, scale-fold at block boundary), `f32mem` (acc8-style memory accumulator) | acc8's low-thread win vs wash-at-32T says this is box-dependent — keep both |
| `scale` | `block_fold` (float(blocksum)·ws·xs per block), `late` (accumulate i32 across kstep, fold once) | `late` is only exact within the no-overflow window — generator computes the window from kstep and refuses invalid combos |
| `load` | `bcast_x` (broadcast activation dword-group × row-vector loads — the repack shape), `bcast_w` | M0 disasm decides which family the winners actually use — don't cargo-cult |
| `prefetch` | off, N bytes ahead (weights) | NT/streaming loads for fat w13/w2 streams is a candidate value (mm_ffn 1.42× is fat-stream territory) |
| `epilogue` | store, `+bias`, `+residual`, `+requant` | fused-chain epilogues become perm values instead of hand variants |
| `tail` | masked (zmm k-masks only), padded, scalar | d-tail and ntok-tail handling; per-ISA legality applies |
| `bake` | none, `k` (n and nblocks become IR constants) | the per-model axis — **deferred** |

## Tuning axes

- **Per-ISA:** which dot primitives exist at all — `cpu_supports` gating, as today.
- **Per-box:** the manifest. Tune run on the box writes it; normal runs stamp from it.
- **Per-model:** deferred (see settled/deferred #3).
- **Per-regime:** decode GEMV vs batch GEMM — GEMV perms are a sub-family (`nr = 1`,
  latency-shaped) swept separately; regime selection is distinct stub functions at the
  call site.

Sweep cost stays sane because the sweep unit is a kernel-level iso bench (the
`bench_gemm_iso.das` / `gemm_1core_probe.das` pattern) on real slot shapes, not end-to-end
decode — the tune_kernels sweep is ~1 min today; the perm sweep targets the same order.

## Milestones

**P1 — `[llvm_code]` minimal (the vehicle — START HERE).**
Annotation recognized by the JIT; generator-call machinery; ABI helper; decline path;
`llvm_user_modules.das` wiring. Hard-coded toy generator (e.g. a vector `add`) to prove the
loop: **gate — generated function bit-exact vs its reference body on this Mac, IR visible
via `--jit-dump`, decline falls back to the body cleanly.**

**M0 — reference ceiling (Mac edition; position 0: build the instrument first).**
Extend `harness/oracle/kernel_bench.cpp` to call llama.cpp's arm repack GEMM family
(`arch/arm/repack.cpp` q8_0 path) and disasm their winning NEON kernel: actual tile shape,
dot sequence, scale-fold point, load family. Dump OUR laneq tier (`--jit-dump` rail) for
the same shapes. **Note:** lcpp's Mac *prefill* number rides Accelerate/AMX (`-ngl 0` still
uses BLAS for pp) — so the honest M2 comparator on this box is **our arm64-laneq tier**
(approach validation: can generated IR beat our best hand kernel), with lcpp CPU columns as
reference. The absolute lcpp-parity chase stays x64 territory. **Gate: ceiling table per
slot shape + target IR shape on paper.**

**M1 — raw primitive emitters.**
The primitives one level down from today's whole-dot intrinsics: sdot-accumulate on given
vreg values, dword-group/lane broadcast, interleaved q-reg loads (NEON leg first); then
vpdpbusd-accumulate, sign-apply, k-masked loads, NT loads (x64 leg, emission-only via
`DAS_JIT_X64_FORCE_FEATURES` + `llc`). Plain emitter helpers inside dasLLVM — they compose
IR values, no das-side fallback of their own. **Gate: disasm of each helper matches the
hand-expected instruction, no verifier errors.**

**M2 — ONE hand-composed perm (the GO/NO-GO).**
Hand-emit one sdot register tile (M0-informed shape) as a single `[llvm_code]` stub +
hard-coded generator — no tune framework yet; the generator IS what the real generator
would produce for that one perm. Bit-exact vs the reference body; iso ABBA on kv/qo/w13/w2/cls
shapes at 1-core and multi-thread vs the laneq batch baseline. **Gate: the hand perm beats
or matches laneq on ≥1 slot shape. If it can't even match a hand kernel, stop and rethink —
we've spent one kernel, not a framework.**

**M3 — parts 2 + 3 proper.**
Tune-framework migration to dasLLVM (tune macro, three modes, manifest + its two APIs);
promote the M2 generator into the perm-parameterized family; `get_repack_type` generation;
2–3 neighbor perms bit-exact (a laneq-equivalent perm as self-check); vreg-budget/ISA
rejection tested; test-run mode gates everything. **Gate: generated == hand-emitted for the
M2 perm (same disasm); neighbors bit-exact; manifest round-trip (tune → write → normal run
stamps the winner).**

**M4 — tune + fleet + the deletion.**
Perm sweep on the Mac → manifest; Mac fleet re-sweep (`emission_bench` pp512 method);
Zen2 leg (avx2/maddubs perms); wake the EPYC for the zvnni leg + Genoa fleet re-score of
the 0.73–0.86× column. Hand-written kernel tiers get deleted only when the scoreboard says
the generated family covers them. Repack generation lands here (needed as soon as a
`grp<mr>` perm wins somewhere).

## M0/M1 results (2026-07-04, M1 Max, LLVM 22.1.5)

**M0 ceiling table** — single-thread, best-of-6, ntok=128, GMAC/s. lcpp = `kernel_bench`
(direct `ggml_gemm_q8_0_4x4_q8_0` / `ggml_gemv_q8_0_4x4_q8_0` calls, repacked, dotprod tier —
what the repack traits select on M1); ours = `gemm_1core_probe` (now platform-aware: enumerates
registered backends, per-backend repack copies, gemv column).

| shape | lcpp gemm 4x4 | **ours laneq batch** | ratio | lcpp gemv | ours laneq gemv |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| kv 2048×512 | 122.4 | **131.0** | 1.07× | 65.1 | 62.5 |
| qo 2048×2048 | 120.8 | **128.1** | 1.06× | 64.2 | 61.2 |
| w13 2048×5632 | 118.3 | **128.9** | 1.09× | 55.9 | 53.3 |
| w2 5632×2048 | 119.1 | **132.2** | 1.11× | 56.1 | 53.4 |

**Our hand laneq tier already beats lcpp's arm repack GEMM kernel-to-kernel on every shape.**
Disasm (their dylib vs our cached JIT DLL): identical 32-sdot lane-indexed core + 16 q-reg
loads per 32-k block on both sides; our edge = f32 scales pre-converted at repack (no
per-block `fcvtl`, one `ldp q` per 2 blocks), token-scale folded into lane-indexed `fmla`,
u2 block unroll. Their traversal re-streams weights ntok/4 times (4-token groups outer);
ours streams weights once per token-block (TB=128). row-major vec_dot 37 / portable 33 /
row-major sdot4x4 44 — repack tier ≈ 3× row-major on both engines. **M2 bar: ≥ ~130 GMAC/s.**

**M1 platform-independent-reduce experiment** (`harness/oracle/reduce_experiment.ll`,
`opt -O3 | llc -mcpu=apple-m1`, same LLVM 22.1.5 the JIT pins):

| generic IR form | arm64 | x64 znver4 |
|---|---|---|
| `vecreduce.add(mul(sext,sext))` → scalar | `sdot` + `addv` ✓ | `vpmovsxbw`+`vpmaddwd`+hadd (sane, no VNNI) |
| `partial.reduce.add(v4i32, mul(sext,sext))` | **single `sdot`** ✓ | zmm widening + `vpmulld` + extracts — garbage |
| lane-splat shuffle + partial.reduce | `dup` + plain sdot (lane NOT folded) | — |
| full block loop, generic IR only | tight hand-shaped loop, 8 dup + 8 sdot, zero spills ✓ | — |
| `@llvm.aarch64.neon.sdot` + shuffle | **indexed `sdot v,v,v[lane]`, zero dups** | n/a |

**Design conclusion:** the generator emits platform-independent IR for everything structural
(loop nest, interleaved loads, accumulators, scale folds, epilogues — all proven to lower
hand-shaped on arm64), and keeps a per-ISA emitter ONLY for the dot primitive — on arm64 a
~3-op emitter (`shufflevector` + `aarch64.neon.sdot`) that buys the indexed form (generic
partial.reduce leaves one `dup` per sdot: +100% vector µops on the 4×4 tile's dot core); on
x64 per-ISA dot emitters were already mandatory (no generic form selects a dot). An ISA with
no dot emitter = generator declines = reference body — the decline path IS the fallback tier.
This validates the perm vector: `dot` is the only per-ISA knob; everything else is generic IR.

## M2 result (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — GO

The hand-composed perm shipped as `[llvm_code]` end to end: `dasllama/dasllama_gemm_gen.das`
(the generator — emits the laneq 4×4 tile as IR: byte-GEP loads, phi loop with kstep=2 paired
blocks + odd-block tail, indexed sdot via intrinsic+shuffle, f32-scale block fold, v4f32
stores; runs in the llvm-jit context, wired via `llvm_user_modules.das`),
`dasllama/dasllama_math_gen.das` (the `[llvm_code]` stub — reference body = 4 single-token
laneq4 dots — plus the `arm64-laneq-gen` backend: arm64-laneq with only the batch tile
swapped), `harness/gen_parity_probe.das` (the exactness gate).

- **Bit-exact:** maxdiff **0** vs the hand laneq semantics on nb-even, nb-odd (tail path) and
  a production slice — identical fold order ⇒ identical bits, not a tolerance pass.
- **Machine code:** 96 sdot / **0 dup** in the tile loop — the indexed-sdot fold held in
  production; firing proven by the generator's named blocks in `--jit-dump`.
- **Iso (gemm_1core_probe, interleaved best-of-6, GMAC/s):** generated vs hand laneq batch —
  kv 130.4 vs 131.2 (−0.6%), qo **129.4 vs 126.8 (+2.1%)**, w13 **129.9 vs 128.8 (+0.9%)**,
  w2 **133.7 vs 131.7 (+1.5%)**. Matches-or-beats on all four shapes; all above lcpp's
  118–122. Gate ("beat or match laneq on ≥1 shape") passed with margin — **M3 is a go.**

Notes for M3: the impl inlines into its public wrapper (and the batch worker) for free; the
das-side const model wants IR-handle helper params spelled `var` (`LLVMOpaqueValue?` non-var
constifies the whole value chain — llvm_boost's `*Aligned` wrappers were fixed to return
non-const for the same reason); LLVM's verifier enforces phi-grouping in merge blocks —
create all phis before any other instruction. The `llvm_user_modules.das` dasllama require was
branch-local wiring at M2; the `require ?` gate landed with M3 (see below) — dasLLVM no longer
hard-depends on dasLLAMA.

## M3 result (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — tune framework + perm-parameterized family shipped

**Part 2 shipped** as `modules/dasLLVM/daslib/llvm_tune.das`: `[tune_perm(...)]` grid rows + a
trailing `[tune(gen = "generator_key", fallback = "suffix")]` on the reference function.
`DAS_TUNE_MODE` picks the mode — normal stamps exactly one winner's `[llvm_code]` onto the
function itself (manifest authoritative when present: no entry ⇒ reference body; else
`fallback=`; else reference); tune/test stamp the full grid as `<name>__<suffix>` clones plus
a `<name>_variants()` registry (emitted reference-row-only in normal mode too, so harnesses
compile/lint everywhere). Manifest = flat `{ "fn name": "perm suffix" }` JSON, **per-app by
opt-in** (Boris: a shared default is a non-starter — two apps stomp): the app declares
`[tune_manifest(name = "myapp", dir = "...")]` on `main`, and the manifest lives at
`<dir>/<name>.tune.json` resolved against the declaring file's directory (the
`get_this_module_dir` pattern — distinct names disambiguate apps sharing a folder).
`DAS_TUNE_MANIFEST` env overrides the declaration; neither ⇒ no manifest (fallback perms).
Because the root module compiles last, the declaration cannot feed the library `[tune]`
applies — instead its own apply **re-stamps** every `[tune]`-annotated function in the
program from the declared manifest (grids re-read from the by-then-attached annotations),
and injects an `[init]` so the runtime write API targets the same file. The two APIs:
`tune_manifest_get` (read-your-own-value) and `tune_manifest_set` (the harness write).
Known edges: constant-arg call sites compiled before a late re-stamp may stay on the
reference tier (bit-exact by contract; pointer-shaped kernels unaffected), and in
multi-program processes a shared library module keeps the stamps of the first program that
compiled it. Round-trip test: `modules/dasLLVM/tests/llvm_tune_manifest.das` (temp-copied client,
declaration-driven write → re-stamp → k2 tier observed).
Framework worked example: `llvm_code_selftest::add_plus_k` (emits `a+b+k` from the perm arg +
a `decline=true` rail); suite test `tests/jit_tests/llvm_code`/`llvm_tune`; CLI gates green
(grid rows 5/6/7 with declined→5, set-API → normal-run consume, authoritative-absence).

**Part 3 (M3 slice): the M2 generator is now the perm-parameterized family**
(`dasllama_gemm_gen::q8q8_tile`; stub renamed `q8q8_tile_gen`, a `[tune]` client with grid
kstep 1|2|4, kstep2+nrsplit2, and three deliberate decline rows). Knobs: `kstep` (blocks per
main-loop iteration; remainder emitted as a chain of conditional single blocks so kstep=2 IS
the M2 CFG), `nrsplit` (tokens per accumulator slice — the 4-token call contract is fixed;
nrsplit=2 runs the k-loop twice at half register pressure), `mr` + `dot`. Strides derive from
`q8q8_repack_type(mr)` in `dasllama_gemm_schema.das` — one function read by the generator at
emit time and by the runtime repack side, so layout and kernel cannot desync (`get_repack_type`
delivered as this shared derivation rather than a second generated function; revisit the
two-function form when repack generation lands). Decline rails in order: no per-ISA dot
emitter (`dot != "sdot"` on this leg), illegal perm values, q-reg budget
(`2·mr + nrsplit·mr/4 + 2·nrsplit + 2 > 32`), layout contract (`mr != 4` until M4 — the
reference body's grp4 semantics ARE the stub contract).

**Gates, all green:**
- *Generated == hand-emitted for the M2 perm:* disasm of the kstep2 tile vs the M2 baseline —
  291/291 instructions identical (only objdump symbol-name annotations differ, from the stub
  rename); 96 sdot / 0 dup preserved.
- *Neighbors bit-exact + genuinely generated:* test mode = all 8 rows exact vs the hand-laneq
  oracle on nb-even, nb-odd, production slice; per-variant disasm proves distinct shapes —
  kstep1/2/4 = 32/96/224 sdots, nrsplit2 = 96 sdots across two loop skeletons, and all three
  decline rows instruction-identical to the reference body (the rejection rail, machine-code
  proven).
- *Manifest round-trip:* tune run (2048×512×64 iso, interleaved best-of-6) — kstep2 **133.9**
  GMAC/s > kstep4 133.4 > kstep1 126.9 > kstep2_nrsplit2 119.6 > declined/reference ~85; the
  M2 perm wins on this box, consistent with the hand tier's shipped u2. Winner written via
  `tune_manifest_set`; the normal run stamps kstep2 *from the manifest* (log rail) and parity
  stays exact. Probes: `harness/gen_parity_probe.das` (normal mode), `gen_tune_probe.das`
  (DAS_TUNE_MODE=test|tune).

**Framework mechanics learned (load-bearing):** a function's annotations attach only AFTER
every apply runs — `[tune]` cannot read `[tune_perm]` siblings off `func.annotations`, so rows
route through a macro-context registry and *must be listed before* `tune(...)` in the bracket
(loud error otherwise); grid clones are annotation-free for the same reason. `generator` and
`default` are grammar keywords — annotation args are `gen=` / `fallback=`. Tuned functions
need an explicit return type (`function_to_type` runs pre-infer; an implicit result reaches
the registry as `auto`). Stamped declarations don't get their own `apply`, so `[tune]` forces
`sideEffectFlags.userScenario` itself (the P1 const-fold lesson).

**Generator wiring decoupled (post-M3 follow-up, same day):** `llvm_user_modules` now does
`require ?dasllama/dasllama_gemm_gen dasllama/dasllama_gemm_register` (a new registration shim that
requires the generator implementation). The optional-require guard grew a **target-file
resolvability fallback** (C++: the collector in `ast_parse.cpp` + the parser statement in
`parser_impl.cpp`): a guarded require also loads when the target's own file resolves — i.e.
the das package is mounted — because pure-das packages have no C++ module to guard on. The
original "app requires the implementation first" two-file idea cannot work on the `-jit`
rail: the LLVM chain is injected as an *extra module* and is collected + compiled before the
app root's requires are even scanned. So the opt-in unit is the build/mount, not the app;
registered generators are name-keyed and inert for programs that never `[llvm_code]`-name
them. `typeinfo builtin_module_exists` additionally sees promoted (shared das) modules now,
so the `static_if` guard around the registration call works for das contributors. Tests:
`tests/language/optional_require.das` (+ fixture) pins the resolvability fallback and the
das-module `builtin_module_exists`; `modules/dasLLVM/tests/llvm_tune_modes.das` spawns a child
daslang with `DAS_TUNE_MODE=test` and asserts every grid row's runtime value (5/5/6/7/5);
`cant_tune_bad_grids.das` pins all six `[tune]` validation errors.

**Deferred to M4:** loop-hint manifest kind (subsuming `[tuned]`/box_profile — dasllama_tune
stays untouched and shipped this milestone), `grp<mr≠4>` repack generation + the two-function
stamp, per-regime/per-slot perms, Zen2/EPYC legs.

## M4 slice A (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — the two-function stamp + grp<mr> unlock

**Framework: `[tune_companion(fn=, gen=)]`** rows in a `[tune]` bracket (after the perm rows,
before `tune(...)` — the perm bank doubles as the order guard) stamp sibling functions with
the SAME perm from the same manifest entry, in all three modes: normal stamps the winner onto
main + companions; grid modes clone `<companion>__<suffix>` per perm and emit a
`<companion>_variants()` registry; the `[tune_manifest]` re-stamp reaches companions too. One
manifest entry = one perm decision across N functions — manifest-level desync is impossible,
and JIT-time decline coherence comes from the dasllama side sharing ONE decline predicate
between the generators. Selftest generator `llvm_code_selftest::k_value` (emits `return k`
for a `() : int` companion, honors the decline rail); jit_tests assert companion-follows-stamp
on the normal/grid/manifest rails; cant_tune_bad_grids pins 6 new validation branches.

**dasLLAMA: mr is a live axis.** The tile generator is generalized over row quads (rq = mr/4:
weight vectors 2·mr per block at `kg·4·mr + qd·16`, accumulators token×quad, per-quad scale
loads/folds/stores; mr=4 emission is instruction-identical to M2 by construction). The layout
companion `q8q8_layout_gen() : int` (generator emits `ret i32 mr`, reference body returns
grp4's 4) is what the runtime asks: the backend repack slot, the batch traversal strides, and
the mm/group3 slot choice at [init] all read it — `repack_q8q8_grp(mr)` is the one
mr-parameterized executor (byte-identical to repack_q8q8_neon at 4), and mr≠4 token tails /
GEMV / group3 fall to a generic scalar grp<mr> dot (same fold order — the GEMV perm
sub-family stays future work). Grid now: kstep 1|2|4 × nrsplit 4|2 at mr4, kstep 1|2|4 at
nrsplit2+mr8, plus three decline rows (`mr8_budget` = 34 q-regs at nrsplit4, `mr2_lanes` =
mr%4, `dot_vpdpbusd`). Probes are per-variant: the layout variants registry gives each tile
variant its mr, the tune/parity probes repack a fresh copy of the row-major master per
variant, and the oracle is computed ONCE from a grp4 copy (fold order is layout-independent).

**The FMF lesson (load-bearing).** First test run: mr8 × kstep1/kstep4 mismatched by last-ulp
while kstep2 was exact — the AArch64 machine combiner had regrouped the fold's
`(af·s4)·qs` into `af·(s4·qs)` in those loop shapes, licensed by the blanket `fast` flags
(`_jit_fast_math` stamps 0x7f on every FP instruction pre-opt). Fix in two halves:
`apply_fast_math_to_module` now fills ONLY instructions with unset flags (authored FMF wins),
and the generator authors `0x7e` (contract kept, reassoc cleared) on the fold's fmul/fadd —
the fold order is the exactness contract, so it lives in the IR flags, not in optimizer luck.
fmla fusion is untouched (contract), and the shipped kstep2 machine code is bit-identical
before/after (289/289 disasm gate below).

**Gates, all green:**
- *Grid test mode:* 13/13 rows bit-exact vs the hand-laneq oracle (incl. all three mr8 rows on
  their own grp8 repack, and the three decline rows on grp4 — the lockstep rail proven by the
  layout variants reporting 4 for declined perms).
- *Disasm invariance:* normal-mode kstep2 (the M2 perm) — 289/289 instructions identical to
  the pre-slice generator (only absolute DLL base addresses differ).
- *mr8 structure:* kstep2_nrsplit2_mr8 = 192 sdot / 0 dup (2 slices × 3 blocks × 32), all 24
  folds fmul+fmla-fused; kstep1_nrsplit2_mr8 = 64 sdot / 0 dup — genuinely distinct shapes.
- *Parity probe:* bit-exact on all three shapes under BOTH the fallback (mr4) and a manifest
  mr8 stamp — the production two-function round-trip (manifest → layout report → grp8 backend
  repack → generated tile). The oracle is always a grp4-copy laneq4 pass: the fold order is
  layout-independent, and the generic scalar dot must NOT be an oracle — full fast-math may
  reassociate ITS fold (first probe draft tripped exactly that, maxdiff ~5e-7). Corollary
  worth remembering: mr≠4 token tails / generic GEMV are correct but not bit-stable vs the
  vector tiers under fast-math — the exactness gates pin the TILE, which does the bulk.
- `LLVM_JIT_CODEGEN_VERSION` 0x37 → 0x38 (generator emission changed for fixed args).

## M4 slice B (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — the sweep: a perm the hand tier never had wins

**FP-laxity policy (Boris, same day):** bit-exactness across variants is NOT the standard —
llama.cpp holds no cross-kernel bit-parity, and `_jit_fast_math` is already declared
non-bit-exact program-wide. The reassoc pin measured as −2.5% on the kstep4-mr8 shape (the
machine combiner's regroup is a critical-path optimization), so it's dropped: generated folds
get the same blanket fast-math as all das code, and the probes gate on a TOLERANCE vs the
grp4-laneq oracle (CLOSE_REL 1e-4 / CLOSE_ABS 1e-5; legal drift observed ~1e-6 relative,
real generator bugs are orders louder — 11/13 grid rows still land bit-exact, only the
loop shapes where the combiner fires drift). The dasLLVM authored-FMF-wins semantics and the
companion const-fold guard stay — they're correct framework behavior regardless of policy.
`LLVM_JIT_CODEGEN_VERSION` 0x38 → 0x39.

`DAS_TUNE_MODE=tune` gen_tune_probe, kv-shape iso (2048×512×64, interleaved best-of-6,
GMAC/s): **kstep4_nrsplit2_mr8 wins at 137.5** — kstep2_nrsplit2_mr8 135.8 > kstep2 133.2
(the hand-tier-equivalent M2 perm) > kstep4 132.6 > kstep1 126.6 > kstep4_nrsplit2 120.1 >
kstep2_nrsplit2 118.6 > kstep1_nrsplit2_mr8 116.1 > kstep1_nrsplit2 115.3 >
declined/reference ~85. The 8-row × 2-slice × 4-block tile (16 weight vectors per block,
26 q-regs) did not exist in the hand tier — the generator+sweep found a shape hand-writing
never tried, worth **+3.3% over the shipped hand kernel** on this box. Manifest round-trip
green (winner written via tune_manifest_set → normal run stamps tile+layout from it → grp8
repack → parity within tolerance; nb-even/odd small shapes exact — kstep4's remainder chain
is straight-line, the regroup only fires in the 4-block main loop). The kstep2-mr4 fallback's
machine code stays 289/289 identical to the M2 baseline.

**Manifest missing-entry semantics flipped (same day, Boris):** entry > `fallback=` >
reference, on both the env path and the `[tune_manifest]` re-stamp (which now leaves
functions without an entry untouched instead of stripping them to reference). `"reference"`
stays expressible as an explicit entry. Pinned by llvm_tune_manifest's OTHER/REF assertions
and a GEMM-client env-path check (missing entry → `kstep2 (fallback)` in the stamp log).

## M4 slice C (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — arm64-laneq-gen is the load-select tier

**The generated family stops being probe-only.** `dasllama_common` requires `dasllama_math_gen`
behind a new **PATH guard** — `require ?llvm/daslib/llvm_tune dasllama/dasllama_math_gen` — and
the backend registers at **priority 25** with full slots, so `select_matmul_backend_for_load`
picks it over arm64-laneq (20) on arm64+jit: every Q8 model load runs the generated batch tile.
No manifest → the kstep2 fallback stamp = the M2 perm, machine-code-identical to the hand tile
(289/289), with the laneq mm/group3/rows/mx4 slots byte-shared — promotion is numerically
invisible until a manifest says otherwise. arm64-laneq stays registered for by-name pins/A-B.

**`require ?` grew a path-guard form** (core parser, both walkers): a guard containing `/` is
resolved as a FILE and there is NO target-resolvability fallback — the witness for a target
living in an always-present package (dasLLAMA's own mount) while depending on an optional one
(dasLLVM). Plain-name guards keep the registered-module-else-target-file semantics. Pinned by
two new optional_require rows (path-guard present → loaded; absent → skipped even though the
target file resolves).

**Slot coverage follows the stamped layout — decided at SELECTION time, not [init] (the
slice C bug, and the load-bearing lesson).** The first cut branched on `q8q8_layout_gen()`
inside the registration `[init]` — and `[init]`s run BEFORE the JIT installs generated code,
so the companion answered with its reference grp4 there while the load-time repack (a
runtime call) used the stamped mr8: laneq grp4 readers on grp8 weights. Every kernel-level
gate passed (they sit below the slot wiring); the model run generated fluent-looking garbage
that even benched "fast" — caught only by a token-print (`parity.das` GEN_IDS) and pinned by
the new `harness/gen_slot_parity_probe.das` (portable reference vs the gen backend through
the REAL rail: pin → backend repack → mm/batch/group3 wrappers; batch passed, mm/group3
failed exactly as grp4-readers-on-grp8 predicts). This is the same lifecycle wrinkle the
dastest-jit reference-tier note flagged — generalized: **nothing may consume a JIT-stamped
value at [init]-time.**

The fix: `KernelBackend.available : function<():bool>` — evaluated by
`select_matmul_backend_for_load` / `pin_kernel_backend` at runtime (registration-time
auto-activate deliberately does NOT evaluate it) — and TWO statically-correct flavors:
- **arm64-laneq-gen** (priority 25, `available` = stamped layout == 4): generated batch tile
  + the byte-identical laneq mm/group3/groupn/rows + interleaved mx4 family +
  `mx4_expand_interleaved` (six neon kernels flipped public for the cross-module borrow).
- **arm64-grp-gen** (priority 24, `available` = stamped layout != 4): generated batch tile +
  generic grp<mr> mm/group3 + NEW `q8q8_groupn_grp_generic` (per-region generic GEMV + bias
  post-add), NO rows core (fused chains fall back to per-op), and a **row-major mx4 family**
  (identity plane repack + sdot-tier kernels): interleaved planes + a grp<mr> Q8 scratch
  can't share the laneq expand map, so the expand goes row-major and repacks the scratch
  through the backend's own Q8 repack. mr≠4 decode rides the generic scalar GEMV — the GEMV
  perm sub-family is exactly the next coverage item, so an mr8 manifest today is a
  prefill-experiment config, not a daily driver.

Pinned by: gen_slot_parity_probe green at BOTH layouts (mr8 row tail within tolerance,
everything else maxdiff 0), parity.das mr8 GEN_IDS **token-for-token identical** to the
default stream (40 greedy tokens), and a portable unit test
(`test_backend_availability_predicate`: priority-99 unavailable backend skipped by for-load
select, refused by pin).

`emission_bench` gained the `DASLLAMA_PIN_BACKEND` rail its siblings had plus a
`backend:` log line (the sweep evidence). Batch-pin note: the donor layout guard compares
repack function POINTERS, so laneq⇄gen cross-pins are rejected even at byte-identical mr=4 —
no current config needs them; revisit if a real pin does.

**Gates:** language 1087/1087 (+2 path-guard rows), jit 305/305, dasLLAMA suite 179/179 (under
the promoted backend — the whole suite now loads models through the gen tile), gen_parity_probe
exact, grid test 13/13, gen_slot_parity_probe both layouts, parity.das token checks both
stamps.

### Slice C fleet re-sweep (M1 Max, 8 lanes, emission_bench -p 512 -n 64 --nprompts 3)

A = `DASLLAMA_PIN_BACKEND=arm64-laneq` (pre-slice hand tier), B = default (arm64-laneq-gen,
kstep2 fallback), back-to-back per model + ABBA anchors (1B/8B — run-to-run drift ±6%, so
±5% is noise). C = mr8 manifest (arm64-grp-gen, `kstep4_nrsplit2_mr8`), `-n 16 --nprompts 2`,
POST-fix (the pre-fix C numbers were garbage-but-fast and are not reported). pp = 512000/ttft.

Ratios: **B/A pp median 1.01 (0.97–1.11), B/A emit median 1.00 (0.96–1.03)** —
**the promotion is perf-neutral; the gen backend supersedes arm64-laneq as the load-select
tier at zero cost.** C/A pp median 1.01 (0.49–1.25), C/A emit median 0.98 (0.54–1.05).

What the honest C column says:
- **The mr8 prefill win is real and fleet-visible in the 1.5B–4B dense band:** Qwen3-4B and
  gemma-3-4b +25%, Phi-3.5 +16%, gemma-2-2b +13%, SmolLM2-1.7B +12%, the 1B–1.5B cluster
  +4–8%. Large dense (7B/8B/12B) sits at 1.00 — DRAM-bound, tile shape can't matter.
- **Decode at mr8 (generic grp<mr> GEMV, LLVM-auto-vectorized) is far better than "scalar
  stopgap" suggests:** ≥1.5B models run 0.88–1.05 of the hand laneq GEMV — bandwidth-bound
  decode forgives compute inefficiency. Small models pay hard (135M 0.64, 0.5–0.6B ~0.55).
- **The two mr8 losers are GEMV-shaped, not batch-shaped:** vocab-heavy small models lose
  ttft to the cls GEMV (Qwen2.5-0.5B 0.71 pp, 152k-row cls at scalar), and gpt-oss loses
  half its prefill (0.49) to the row-major mx4 family + row-major-expand-then-repack path.
- **Verdict: mr8 stays a per-app manifest experiment** — the GEMV perm sub-family (grp8-
  reading generated GEMV, next coverage item) and a generated mx4 family are exactly what
  gates flipping it on; the batch-side win it buys is already measured and waiting.

## M4 slice D (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — the GEMV sub-family: the three-function stamp

**The nr=1 perm sub-family lands as a THIRD companion in the same [tune] bracket.**
`q8q8_gemv_gen` is a rows-range core with the mm_rows slot signature (rows [rb, re) of one
region, no internal dispatch, rb/re multiples of the stamped mr), stamped from the SAME
manifest entry as the tile and layout — one entry, one coherent layout+tile+gemv decision;
desync structurally impossible. The generator wraps `emit_slice(tokCount=1)` in an outer
group loop (g-phi, per-group wg/sg GEPs — the group walk lives INSIDE the generated
function, one call per dispatch chunk), reference body = the hand laneq rows walk (grp4).
New knob `gkstep` (1|2|4, GEMV blocks per K-iteration — emit_block's fresh int accumulators
per block are the independent sdot chains a serial single-token laneq chain lacks); the ONE
shared `perm_declines` grows the gkstep rail, so all three generators decline in lockstep.
Grid rows carrying gkstep spell their tile knobs explicitly ("kstep2_gkstep2"), which is
what lets the tune probe key rows back to their tile family (`tile_key` strips the gkstep
piece).

**Every Q8 slot on both backend flavors is now the generated family.** mm/group3/groupn
became das traversals over the rows core (chunk-splitting at region boundaries, bias
post-add das-side), `mm_rows = q8q8_gemv_gen` directly (signature-identical), and the three
grp<mr> generic stopgaps are DELETED — the first hand-kernel deletion the mandate called
for. arm64-grp-gen thereby GAINS a rows core: fused decode chains now work at mr != 4. The
flavors differ only in the mx4 family (laneq interleaved vs row-major — the next coverage
item). The hand laneq mm/group3/groupn/rows borrow is gone from the gen backends;
arm64-laneq stays registered for by-name pins/A-B.

**The sweep grew a GEMV axis and the bench-shape lesson.** The streamed decode shape
(2048x8192, 16MB per call) is DRAM-bound and CANNOT tell kernels apart — even the scalar
reference body matches the vector tiers there (~54 GMAC/s single-thread). Differentiation
needs the cache-resident shape (2048x512 x16 reps): there **mr8 GEMV beats the mr4 hand
walk 67.4-69.0 vs 62.1-63.6 GMAC/s (~+8%)** — grp8 halves activation reloads per row — and
gkstep2 adds ~2%. Tune mode benches tile on the batch shape and gemv on both decode shapes,
then writes the MERGED winner: batch bench picks the tile knobs (and the layout), hot
decode bench picks gkstep among rows sharing those tile knobs. This box writes
`kstep4_nrsplit2_mr8_gkstep2`.

**Gates:** grid test 17/17 rows (tile AND gemv vs the grp4-laneq oracle, both layouts;
mr8 rows show the legal ~2e-6 fast-math regroup drift, mr4 exact); gen_parity_probe tile +
gemv exact at both stamps; gen_slot_parity_probe green at BOTH layouts through the real
rail (mm now rides the generated core — maxdiff 0 at mr4, 1.2e-7 worst at mr8);
parity.das GEN_IDS token-for-token identical default-vs-mr8 on Llama-3.2-1B and
Qwen2.5-0.5B (40 greedy tokens each); dasLLAMA suite under the promoted backend; fleet
C-column re-run on the mr8 loser models (table below). No LLVM_JIT_CODEGEN_VERSION bump:
emit_block/emit_slice untouched (tile emission byte-identical), and the new/changed stamped
functions self-invalidate via their AST hashes.

### Slice D fleet re-check (M1 Max, 8 lanes, emission_bench -p 512 -n 64 --nprompts 2)

B = default (arm64-laneq-gen, kstep2 fallback), C = mr8 manifest (kstep4_nrsplit2_mr8_gkstep2,
arm64-grp-gen), back-to-back per model on an idle box. The slice C C-column for these models
was the generic-scalar GEMV penalty this slice was built to remove.

| model | B pp | C pp | C/B | B emit | C emit | C/B (was, slice C) |
|---|--:|--:|:--:|--:|--:|:--:|
| SmolLM2-135M | 4555 | 4518 | 0.99 | 220.4 | 221.1 | 1.00 (was 0.64) |
| Qwen2.5-0.5B | 1992 | 1986 | 1.00 | 145.4 | 146.0 | 1.00 (was 0.54; pp was 0.71 — the 152k cls GEMV) |
| Qwen3-0.6B | 1497 | 1494 | 1.00 | 96.9 | 96.4 | 1.00 (was 0.59) |

**mr8's fleet story after slice D:** wins +12–25% prefill on 1.5B–4B dense (slice C table,
tile unchanged — gkstep is invisible to the tile), neutral on small AND large dense in both
regimes, loses only gpt-oss (0.49 pp — the row-major mx4 family, exactly the next coverage
item). The mr8 manifest is no longer a prefill-experiment config on Q8 models; a generated
mx4 family is what's left before it's the unconditional daily driver.

## M4 slice E (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — the mx4 family: one backend, one layout, four functions

**MXFP4 joins the stamp (the second quant family) and the two backend flavors merge into ONE
`arm64-gen`.** `mx4q8_gemv_gen` is the fourth companion in the same bracket — the mx4 twin of
the Q8 rows core over grp<mr>-interleaved nibble/exponent planes (`repack_mx4_grp`, the SAME
mr as the Q8 layout: one layout companion drives both repacks). The generator reuses the
whole slice-D loop machinery: `emit_block_mx4` swaps the weight-load stage for `tbl`
LUT-dequant (the doubled-e2m1 LUT baked as a constant vector — no table pointer at runtime;
one v16i8 nibble load per quad per dword-group feeds tbl-lo/tbl-hi + the same indexed-sdot
lattice) and the scale loads for an in-register vectorized `e8m0_half` (zext + the
denormal-select bit trick). `perm_declines` grew the tbl rail — four generators, still ONE
lockstep predicate. mm_mx4/groupn_mx4 are das traversals over the core (region-splitting,
bias post-add, row-major row tails); the mx4 expand's byte-for-byte positional map
generalized to any mr (nibble byte `off` of block-group bg -> q8[bg*32*mr + off] low /
+16*mr high; scale bytes 1:1), reading a new activation-time layout cache
(`KernelBackend.q8_layout` -> `active_q8_layout_mr()`, evaluated at selection time per the
slice C rule). The x64-style expand-row-major-then-repack double pass is arm64-history: the
expand writes the stamped layout directly at every mr.

**The two-flavor split dissolves.** After slice D (Q8 slots layout-driven) + this slice
(mx4 slots layout-driven), arm64-laneq-gen and arm64-grp-gen differed in nothing — merged
into `arm64-gen` (priority 25, no `available` predicate needed), the laneq mx4 borrow and
`repack_mx4_identity` wiring gone. Probes updated to the one name.

**Gates:** grid test 17/17 x THREE kernels (tile, Q8 gemv, mx4 gemv — mx4 bit-exact vs the
hand interleaved walk at mr4, ~6e-5 fast-math drift at mr8, within tolerance);
gen_slot_parity_probe grew mm_mx4 + groupn_mx4 legs (portable reference vs the real rail:
plane repack -> traversals over the generated core) — ALL slots maxdiff 0 at mr4 and mx4
maxdiff 0 at mr8; parity.das gpt-oss GEN_IDS **token-for-token identical default-vs-mr8**
(24 greedy tokens through the full rail: grp8 plane repack -> positional expand -> generated
grp8 mx4 GEMVs -> MoE decode groupn); dasLLAMA suite 179/179.

**gpt-oss fleet check (emission_bench -p 512 -n 64 --nprompts 2, back-to-back):** B (default
grp4) pp 137 t/s / emit 33.0; C (mr8 manifest) pp 145 / emit 35.7 — **the slice C mr8
gpt-oss loss (pp 0.49, the expand double pass + row-major mx4 family) is GONE; mr8 now
matches-or-beats grp4 on gpt-oss too.** With slice D's Q8 GEMV recovery, NO model loses at
mr8 anymore: the mr8 manifest is a legitimate daily driver on this box (+12–25% prefill in
the 1.5B–4B dense band, neutral-or-better everywhere else).

**Found compiler bug (repro'd, not fixed here):** a TERNARY string result passed directly to
an extern's `string implicit` parameter SIGSEGVs the compiler (plain interpolation is fine,
das-wrapper callees are fine, hoisting to a `let` is the dodge). Minimal 10-line repro
against llvm_boost's raw `LLVMBuildBitCast` binding; hit inside emit_block_mx4's s4 naming.

## M4 slice F (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — the x64 dot emitters: one grid, every ISA (emission-proven)

**The x64 legs land in the SAME generator and the SAME grid — `dot` and `width` become real
knobs.** The M1 design conclusion held exactly: the loop nest, interleaved loads, accumulator
tiles, scale folds, lane splats and stores were already generic IR, so the x64 legs are a
`TileEmit` width generalization (`rv` = rows per vector = i32 acc lanes: 4/8/16 at
width 128/256/512; `rq` becomes weight VECTORS per group = mr/rv) plus per-ISA dot chains in
ONE `dot_lane` dispatch:

- `dot=vpdpbusd` (VNNI, u8·s8): the proven dot32/dot64 emitter chain — `llvm.abs` (VPABSB,
  hoisted per weight vector) + VPSIGNB per dot at 256 / compare+negate+select at 512 (no
  512-bit VPSIGNB) + ONE `vpdpbusd.256/.512`. Exactness precondition unchanged from dot32
  (x in [-127,127], w may be -128 — |w| goes on the unsigned side).
- `dot=maddubs` (pre-VNNI, the Zen2 leg): same sign chain, dot = VPMADDUBSW + VPMADDWD(ones)
  + VPADDD (`avx2.pmadd.*` at 256, `avx512.pmaddubs.w.512`/`pmaddw.d.512` at 512).
- `dot=vpdpbssd` (AVX-VNNI-INT8, native s8·s8): ONE `llvm.x86.avx2.vpdpbssd.256`, NO sign
  trick at all (new cpuid tier `avxvnniint8`, leaf-7-subleaf-1 EDX bit 4, added to
  das_cpu_supports + `g_target_x64_vnniint8`; no fleet silicon — emission-only for now;
  the 512-bit form is AVX10-only and declines).
- mx4: `tbl1` -> `pshuf.b` ymm / `pshuf.b.512` (LUT constant broadcast per 16-byte lane;
  indices 0..15 keep bit 7 clear so the zeroing path never fires) — the e8m0 scale fold was
  already generic IR. The x64 rows' mx4/gemv companions come free through the shared slice
  machinery and decline in lockstep (one `perm_declines`, now ISA-aware: tier truth via
  `g_target_x64_*`, geometry mr % rv == 0, vq <= 2, nrsplit*vq <= 8, vreg budget
  2*nrsplit*vq + 6 <= 16 ymm / 32 zmm).

**The emission-only rail on a non-x64 box is now first-class.** `--jit-compile-only` (new JIT
CLI flag): build + verify + optimize (+`--jit-dump`), write/load/install nothing, program runs
interpreted — with `--jit-target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, cross x64 tier gates read
`DAS_JIT_X64_FORCE_FEATURES` as the ONLY tier truth (host cpuid never leaks into a cross
target; no env = no AVX emission, the pre-slice behavior). The TargetMachine feature string on
explicit x64 cross triples now folds the forced features too, and `jit_dll_basename` folds the
target triple (a latent cross-DLL cache-poison fix — a `--jit-target` artifact could
previously cache-hit a host run of the same program).

**Gates (this box):**

- **arm64 UNCHANGED, machine-code-proven:** full-DLL neutralized instruction streams of the
  kstep2-fallback stamp AND the mr8 manifest stamp are byte-identical pre/post refactor
  (64975 + 69681 instruction lines diffed) — no `LLVM_JIT_CODEGEN_VERSION` bump needed.
- **Grid 29/29 on arm64** (13 sdot rows + 12 x64 rows + 3 decline-by-design + reference):
  every x64 row declines to reference semantics, maxdiff 0.
- **Emission proof, 21/21 instruction-count gates green on the FIRST full run**
  (`harness/gen_x64_emission_check.sh`: cross dump -> llc 22.1.5, same major as the dasLLVM
  pin, `-mattr=+avx2,...,+avxvnniint8` -> llvm-objdump): busd256 tile = 96 vpdpbusd / 96
  vpsignb / 24 vpabsb / 0 pair ops; maddubs256 = 96+96 pair / 0 VNNI; bssd256 = 96 vpdpbssd /
  0 sign ops; busd512 = 96 vpdpbusd on zmm, 0 vpsignb; gemv gkstep2 = 24; mx4 = 8 vpshufb + 8
  dots per block. Histogram: 96 single `vpbroadcastd` lane splats (the generic shuffle lowers
  to memory-adjacent broadcasts — the x64 twin of the indexed-sdot zero-dup result), no
  scalarization, no spill storm.
- Slot parity + dasLLAMA/jit suites re-green on arm64; lint/format clean.

**What is deliberately NOT proven here (needs x64 silicon):** semantics of the live x64 stamps
(`DAS_TUNE_MODE=test` gen_tune_probe on Zen2/EPYC — zero extra wiring, the grid + oracle run
as-is; small test fixtures bumped d 8 -> 32 so mr16/mr32 rows have groups to cover), perf
(tune mode sweep -> manifest), and runtime selection (no `x64-gen` backend is registered yet —
see below).

**Queued for the Zen2/EPYC bring-up session (in order):**

1. **The witness companion + `x64-gen` registration.** A fifth `() : bool` companion (reference
   body returns false, generated body returns true, same lockstep predicate) gives the runtime
   the "did the stamp actually fire" bit at SELECTION time (slice C rule) — on x64 a declined
   stamp must not load-select the gen backend (its reference bodies are the scalar NEON
   fallbacks there, ~3x slower than portable). Registration mirrors arm64-gen: the das
   traversals are already ISA-agnostic.
2. Semantics + tune sweep on silicon (test mode, then tune mode -> per-box manifest; Zen2 =
   maddubs family, EPYC = vpdpbusd zmm — the session-5 lcpp zmm-engine fight).
3. gen_parity_probe's small shapes assume mr <= 8 (d=8 fixtures) — bump like gen_tune_probe
   when an mr16 manifest is actually in play.

**Ledger (perf ideas spotted, not chased):**

- **bias128 repack for vpdpbusd:** bake `w ^ 0x80` into the grp<mr> plane at repack (schema
  field, layout-companion-driven so it can't desync), dot becomes `vpdpbusd(acc, w_biased,
  x)` + one per-(block,token) correction `128 * blocksum(x)` folded at scale time — kills the
  per-dot VPSIGNB (~28% of the busd dot-stage µops). Exact (u8 = w+128 in [0,255], x s8);
  does NOT work for maddubs (PMADDUBSW pair sums saturate at 255·127·2). Measure against the
  plain sign-trick perm on silicon before adopting.
- Per-ISA `fallback=` in [tune] (the declared fallback "kstep2" is an arm64 perm; on x64 with
  no manifest the family declines to reference — correct because selection is witness-gated,
  but a per-target fallback would give manifest-less x64 boxes a live default).
- NT/streaming weight loads for the fat w13/w2 batch streams (the mm_ffn 1.42x note) — now
  expressible as a perm knob on the x64 legs.

**TIGHTEN EMISSION (Boris, 2026-07-04: "the biggest thing" — the follow-up session(s)
agenda).** The generator wins on structure; the next wins are inside the emitted lattice:

1. **bias128 repack for vpdpbusd** (above) — kills the per-dot VPSIGNB, ~28% of the busd
   dot-stage µops; layout-companion field, exact. **→ DONE, slice H** (emitted + gated;
   silicon measurement = next SPR/EPYC session).
2. **The kstep4@512 collapse** (SPR scout sweep: busd512 kstep2 88.3 vs kstep4_nrsplit2 63.0
   GMAC/s): diagnose via disasm — spills? scheduling? If it's acc pressure, the budget rail
   is too permissive at 512; if scheduling, the block-emission order needs a k-interleave.
   **→ CLOSED, slice H**: no spills, no scheduling — nrsplit2 halves weight-vector token
   reuse, doubling the sign-trick preamble per dot; bias128 deletes the preamble.
3. **Broadcast amortization**: one vpbroadcastd per dot today (96/tile) — an 8-byte k-group
   layout (qword broadcast serving 2 dword-groups) halves them; pairs naturally with the
   future smmla family's 2-token pairing. Layout-companion territory, new `kgroup` knob.
4. **Weight-load/dequant fusion on x64 mx4**: the nibble->pshufb->sign chain re-derives |w|
   per lookup; a biased-LUT variant (bake |lut| + sign plane) could drop abs entirely.
5. Per-slot perms (M4 open item): the batch tile and the gemv core want different winners
   already (SPR: gkstep2 helps gemv, kstep2 tile) — one manifest entry per SLOT family.
6. New dot families when silicon arrives: smmla/i8mm (the parked branch, the other Mac),
   SME (if that Mac is M4), AMX (the lcpp Intel ceiling — tile ISA, biggest lift, biggest
   prize), vpdpbssd on Sierra-Forest-class metal.

## M4 slice G (2026-07-04, Zen2 3990X + M1 Max) — the witness five-function stamp + x64-gen

**The witness closes the stamp** (`q8q8_family_live() : bool`, the fifth companion): reference
body false, generated body `return true`, declining through the ONE shared predicate — so
"witness true" ⟺ "every slot is generated code". It is read ONLY at backend-selection time
(the slice C rule), and it is what makes `x64-gen` registrable: on x64 a declined stamp's
reference bodies are the NEON functions' scalar fallbacks (~9.5 GMAC/s vs portable's ~19), so
an un-emitted family must never load-select. `x64-gen` registers over the SAME ISA-agnostic
slot traversals as arm64-gen (priority 25, needs_repack, `available = @@q8q8_family_live`,
avx2 minimum); arm64-gen keeps no predicate (a declined stamp still leaves the fast grp4
reference pair there). gen_tune_probe test mode now asserts the lockstep invariants (mr !=
reference ⟹ witness live; reference row ⟹ not live) and prints live/ref per row.

**The Zen2 bring-up (Boris's 3990X desktop, native Windows/MSVC + VS2026, repo E:\das,
models D:\Work\llama.cpp\models, ssh `zen2`):**

- **Grid on silicon:** GEN TUNE TEST OK — both maddubs-256 rows live at mr=8, BIT-EXACT
  (maxdiff 0) for tile + Q8 gemv + pshufb mx4 gemv on the first-ever x64 run; every
  VNNI/512/vnniint8 row declines per cpuid. Tune sweep winner
  `dot_maddubs_width256_mr8_kstep2` -> zen2_manifest.json (the x64 manifest round-trip).
- **Slot parity through the REAL rail** (pin x64-gen, grp8 repack, generated cores): ALL
  slots maxdiff 0 at the maddubs stamp; the no-manifest leg SKIPs loudly via the witness
  (pin refused, portable kept). **The probe caught a real fixture bug on the way:** its
  activations were raw random int8 INCLUDING -128, violating the documented sign-trick
  precondition (PSIGNB of -128 wraps; the Q8 quantizer guarantees [-127,127] by construction
  — verified in dasllama_quant). arm64 never noticed (sdot has no precondition). Fixed:
  activations use the quantizer's range, weights stay full-range (w = -128 must stay covered).
- **Registered A/B (gemm_1core_probe, same slots, interleaved best-of-6):** x64-gen batch
  52.6–53.2 GMAC/s vs acc8 30.9–32.1 (the best hand tier) and repack ~26 — **1.65–1.7x over
  acc8, ~2x over the layout-comparable repack tier, on all four shapes**; gemv 1.3–1.5x.
  The Zen2/AVX2 hand-tier class is decisively covered on the deletion scoreboard.
- **e2e:** parity.das Llama-3.2-1B GEN_IDS token-for-token identical, no-manifest rail vs
  x64-gen maddubs-mr8 rail (24 greedy tokens); emission_bench logs `backend: x64-gen (batch:
  x64-gen)` and reads ~994 t/s prefill-512 / 36.1 t/s emit on Llama-1B (llama.cpp yardstick
  on this box = next session; needs a Windows llama-bench build check).
- arm64 unchanged: grid witness column correct (sdot rows live, x64 rows ref), slot parity
  both stamps, dasLLAMA suite 179/179.

**Prefill is the win column on Zen2** — the generated batch tile scales with threads while
lcpp's Zen2 path stays flat (no zmm engine there; the pre-gen +20%@32C observation,
amplified). **Decode losses shrink with size (0.47 -> 0.93)** and are the KNOWN
dispatch-side issue (tiny models single-lane most matmuls under the 2M par threshold — the
queued per-lane-regime item), not kernels: the registered A/B has our GEMV 1.3–1.5x ahead.

**Still open after G:** the decode dispatch work above; a full-fleet pass with the zen2
manifest; loop-hint manifest kind; per-slot perms; then the deletion (the hand AVX tiers are
now beaten on Zen2 — EPYC zvnni is the remaining leg before the x64 matrix goes).

## M4 slice H (2026-07-04, M1 Max) — tighten emission I: the kstep4@512 verdict + bias128

**The kstep4@512 collapse, diagnosed from the scout dump (ledger item 2 — CLOSED).** Both
variants' machine code is clean: ZERO spills (no stack traffic in either loop), no
scheduling pathology, memory-operand `vpbroadcastd` splats throughout. The collapse is
reuse geometry: nrsplit2 halves the tokens per k-pass (4 -> 2), so every weight vector's
sign-trick preamble (load + VPABSB + VPMOVB2M) amortizes over HALF the dots — per 64-dot
iteration, kstep2/nrsplit4 spends 16 loads + 16 abs + 16 masks where kstep4_nrsplit2 spends
32/32/32 (and streams the whole weight plane TWICE per tile call). At width512/mr16 (rq=1)
there is no register pressure for the split to relieve — 26/32 zmm live at nrsplit4 — so it
is pure loss: +17% dot-stage µops (339 vs 289 instructions for the same 64 dots), 2x weight
load traffic ⇒ 88.3 -> 63.0 (port math alone predicts ~0.86x; the doubled weight streaming
eats the rest). The same knob WINS on arm64 (kstep4_nrsplit2_mr8, 137.5) because sdot has
no per-weight preamble AND the q-reg budget (2mr + nrsplit·mr/4 + 2·nrsplit + 2 > 32) makes
nrsplit4 illegal at mr8 — there the split is what unlocks mr8 at all. Verdict: the budget
rail is correct (nrsplit4@512 is legal and wins; the sweep rejects the loser); the collapse
is the sign-trick preamble amplified — which bias128 (item 1) deletes.

**bias128 (ledger item 1) — the design.** Bake `w ^ 0x80` into the grp&lt;mr&gt; plane at repack
(u8 = w+128 ∈ [0,255]); the dot becomes plain `vpdpbusd(acc, w_biased, x)` — no VPABSB, no
VPMOVB2M/VPSIGNB, no masked VPSUBB. Exact: Σ(w+128)·x = Σw·x + 128·Σx in i32 (|acc| ≤
~1.6M per block against 2^31), and it REMOVES the x ∈ [-127,127] sign-trick precondition.
The correction is folded as the ACCUMULATOR INIT: acc starts at −128·Σx(block) instead of
zero — the correction costs zero ALU (the vpxor zeroing it replaces was free at rename, the
init is one embedded-broadcast load). Per 64-dot busd512-kstep2 iteration the dot-stage
SIMD-ALU count drops 192 -> 96 (+8 broadcast loads) — the ALU-bound tile ceiling nearly
doubles; SPR tile 88.3 should land 120-150 GMAC/s (silicon next SPR/EPYC session).
vpdpbusd-only: maddubs saturates word pair-sums at biased magnitudes, bssd is native s8·s8.

Transport (where −128·Σx comes from):

- **tile**: a bsums plane `xbsp : int const?` ([ntok x nb] i32, −128·Σx per (token, block))
  as the tile's 10th parameter — the tile signature is gen-family-internal (batch wrapper +
  probes only). The batch wrapper computes it once per call before dispatch (O(ntok·n),
  noise against the O(ntok·n·d) dots) when the stamped family is biased.
- **gemv**: mm_rows is a SHARED slot typedef invoked with raw activation planes from the
  fused decode chain — no plane transport. The block's −128·Σx is computed inline (concat
  the two 16-byte chunks, one `vpdpbusd(0, splat(128u8), x)` at kernel width,
  `vector.reduce.add`, negate, splat): ~8 µops per (block, group) against the 24·rq the
  trick removes — and the gemv is bandwidth-bound anyway (SPR: width-insensitive).

Lockstep: a SIXTH companion `q8q8_wbias_gen() : int` (reference 0, generated = the perm's
bias, same shared decline) drives the runtime repack — schema `Q8RepackType` gains `wbias`,
`repack_q8q8_grp` biases the group rows in one extra pass (row-major tails stay unbiased
for the sdot4x4 tail path, which never reads groups). The batch wrapper's generic token
tail (`q8q8_token_grp_generic`) un-biases scalar-wise (`w − wbias`). The mx4-&gt;Q8 expand
(gpt-oss MoE grouped prefill) writes the interleaved branch through a BIASED LUT copy when
the active stamp is biased (tail loop keeps the unbiased LUT); `KernelBackend` carries
`q8_wbias` next to `q8_layout` for that activation-time read. The mx4 EMITTER itself is
untouched (nibble planes and LUT unbiased; biased-LUT fusion is ledger item 4, separate).

Grid: +6 rows — busd 256-mr8/512-mr16 × kstep2 × {plain, gkstep2} biased, a biased
kstep4_nrsplit2@512 (re-tests the collapse with the preamble gone — the weight-stream
doubling remains, so it should still lose, but by less), and a bias-on-maddubs
decline-by-design pin. Emission gates: biased tiles = 96 vpdpbusd / 0 vpsignb / 0 vpabsb /
0 vpmovb2m; biased gemv gk2 = 24 + 3 vpdpbusd (the per-block-instance bsum dots). Zen2
declines every biased row (no VNNI); arm64 unaffected.

**Gates (this box, 2026-07-04):**

- **Emission, 29/29 green on the first full run** (10 new bias128 gates): biased 256/512
  tiles = 96 vpdpbusd / 0 vpsignb / 0 vpabsb / 0 vpmovb2m / 0 vpsubb; biased gemv gk2 = 27
  vpdpbusd (24 dots + 3 inline bsums); every pre-slice gate unchanged.
- **The biased busd512-kstep2 hot loop is 138 instructions per 64-dot iteration vs 289
  unbiased (2.09x, same toolchain/signature)** — the sign trick's 96 SIMD-ALU ops are gone
  AND an unplanned second win landed: with the sign chain no longer separating them, LLVM
  folds every per-dot activation splat INTO the dot as an EVEX embedded broadcast
  (`vpdpbusd -0x30(%rbp,%r14,8){1to16}, %zmm9, %zmm8`) — the 64 standalone vpbroadcastd
  instructions vanish too. Per-iteration SIMD-ALU 192 -> 96 (64 dots + 32 fold ops, nothing
  else); the only remaining loop ops are 16 weight loads + 8 acc-init broadcasts + fold.
  The ALU-bound ceiling roughly doubles; silicon number = next SPR/EPYC session.
- **das rail (interpreted, host-independent):** biased plane == plain plane ^0x80 on group
  bytes with tails and scales untouched; the generic token tail's un-bias (the int8 +128
  involution) is BIT-EXACT against the plain pair.
- **arm64 regression:** grid 35/35 (all six new rows decline to reference; witness/wbias
  lockstep asserted per row), gen parity 3 shapes maxdiff 0, slot parity all slots maxdiff
  0, dasLLAMA suite green. No byte-identity claim this slice — the tile stub gained the
  xbsp parameter (the DLL cache self-invalidates via per-function AST hashes; grid+parity
  +suite are the proof instead).

**Ledger (new):** hoist the batch wrapper's per-call O(ntok·n) bsum pass into the
activation quantizer (a bsums plane in RunState next to xq/xs) — saves one re-read of x
per biased batch matmul and would let a future gen-internal rows core read plane
corrections instead of inline ones. Only worth it once bias128 proves out on silicon.

## M4 slice H — SPR silicon (2026-07-04 night, AWS c7i.metal-24xl)

Box: Xeon Platinum 8488C metal, 48C/96T, avx512_vnni + avx_vnni + amx_int8, **no
avx_vnni_int8** (bssd still unproven on silicon — same as the scout VM). Bring-up = the
EPYC recipe (clang 18, Ninja, DAS_LLVM_DISABLED=OFF), branch tip `b2985e636` via thin
bundle. The scout's caution about VM absolutes was right in the other direction: metal
plain busd512-kstep2 is 105.7 GMAC/s where the scout VM said 88.3.

**bias128 first silicon — everything the emission gates predicted, plus margin:**

- **Grid (DAS_TUNE_MODE=test): 35/35 rows, every row maxdiff 0** (tile+gemv+mx4) —
  first-ever bias128 execution. All five biased rows live+exact; maddubs-bias declines by
  design; bssd declines per cpuid.
- **Sweep: biased busd512-kstep2-gkstep2 tile = 157.9 GMAC/s vs 105.7 plain (+49%)** —
  above the 120-150 prediction. Biased 256 = 120.5 vs 84.6 (+42%). The biased
  kstep4_nrsplit2@512 diagnostic = 137.0: still loses to kstep2 (weight-stream doubling
  remains) but by less (−13% vs −17%), exactly the slice H verdict. GEMV hot: 58.3 biased
  vs 50.1 plain (+16%); stream stays bandwidth-bound ~10.5. Winner
  `dot_vpdpbusd_width512_mr16_kstep2_gkstep2_bias128` → spr_manifest.json. (The sweep's
  tile numbers ride the small tune fixture (d=32); real shapes below are higher.)
- **The first mr16 production stamp caught a real bug:** `q8q8_token_grp_generic`'s
  scratch was `float[8]` — the batch token tail crashed (`dim index out of range`) at the
  mr=16 stamp; no prior box ever stamped mr>8 on production slots. Fix = cap 32 (the
  grid's max stampable mr, busd512-mr32 row), commit `1b4dacddb`. gen_slot_parity_probe
  caught it exactly as designed (the kernel-level grid was green; the slot layer wasn't).
- **Post-fix production gates, all green at the biased mr16 stamp:** slot parity 7/7
  (maxdiff 0 or ~1e-6 fast-math drift, incl. mx4 legs + row/token tails); parity.das
  GEN_IDS **byte-identical default-vs-stamp on Llama-1B and gpt-oss-20b** (the mx4 biased
  LUT expand covered).
- **Registered A/B (gemm_1core, real shapes, 1 core): x64-gen batch 190-200 GMAC/s vs
  best hand tier avx512vnni 47-49 = 4.0-4.3× on every shape** (kv/qo/w13/w2); hot-shape
  gemv (kv 2048×512) 84.4 vs 48.8 (+73%); large-d gemv ~30 vs ~28 (DRAM-bound, as

dense and the MoE flagship (**gpt-oss: pp 1.02 AND emit 1.09 — we beat the AMX build
end-to-end at the knee**; Qwen3-4B pp 1.03; Llama-1B emit 1.02). At T=48 lcpp keeps
scaling while das sits at its knee (the known high-lane regime: das T48 ≈ T24 on every
model here) — same defaults-vs-knee shape as EPYC, now against a stronger ceiling. Tiny
models remain the dispatch story (135M: pp 0.40, emit 0.24-0.31; the 2M par threshold
single-lanes every non-cls matmul — queued per-lane-regime work, NOT kernels: the A/B
above has gen 4× ahead kernel-to-kernel). gemma-3-1b (0.5-0.6 across the board) is the
one dense outlier — 262k vocab cls + pre/post-norm gates fused decode off; worth a
per-op profile next session. AMX as a Tier-3 generator family: the 135M prefill column
(13.3k t/s) is what AMX tiles buy on cache-resident weights — that's the number a
dot=amx_int8 family would chase.

## SPR silicon session 2 (2026-07-05, c7i.metal-24xl respin) — dispatch-arc validation + AMX scout

Respin from the baked AMI at `5f3d80928` (work-proportional dispatch + worker limit + per-op
rank gate). 75-cell paired sweep — 15 models × T{8,16,24,32,48}, gate-on, biased busd512-mr16
manifest stamp, vs the same lcpp-AMX build, prefill AND emit per cell:

- **Fleet emit mean 0.87 vs the AMX build** (zen2's 1.01 parity was vs plain AVX2). The two
  dispatch regimes from session 1 moved: 135M emit ratio 0.24 → 0.70–0.92 with the T-collapse
  gone (peaks T16, T48 ≈ T24); ≥1B dense wins/ties prefill everywhere ≤T24 (Mistral-7B
  1.02–1.10, Llama-8B 1.03–1.10, Phi-3.5 1.05–1.06); **gpt-oss beats the AMX build outright
  (pp 1.38 @T8, 1.16 @T16; emit ≥ 1.00 T16–T32)**. Llama-1B reproduces session 1's knee
  numbers exactly (emit 1.02 @T24).
- **Rank gate promotion evidence complete**: T48 A/B — 135M **+48%** (317.5 vs 214.2), 1B
  neutral. With zen2's +10%/neutral: no observed regression on server cores, both boxes.
- **Affinity/placement exonerated**: pin-one-per-physical-core null (48W lands right by
  itself), spread-rank NEGATIVE on single-socket SPR → experiment retired (zen2 null + SPR
  negative). Residual T48-vs-T8 emit tax (~7%) ≈ active-core turbo physics, not scheduling.
- **AMX scout (single core, userland)**: enable = `arch_prctl(ARCH_REQ_XCOMP_PERM,
  XTILEDATA)` + `ldtilecfg`, no kernel help needed. TMUL reg-resident **3546 GMAC/s = 22×
  the biased-busd512 tier**; tile-load-fed 2175 @1MB / 579 @32MB / 196 GMAC/s @512MB
  zero-reuse. Verdict: **prefill/batch family** (transformative under tile reuse,
  break-even for zero-reuse GEMV streaming). Emitter path is unblocked das-side:
  `LLVMX86AMXTypeInContext` is already in bindings/llvm_func.das:374 and llvm_boost has
  name-based intrinsic lookup — `llvm.x86.tdpbssd.internal` & co. reachable with zero C++.
- **Per-op decode leads (decode_prof @T24)**: Qwen3-0.6B — attn_chain 50–54% of time vs
  ~36% traffic share (28 deep-thin layers + per-head QK-norm; dispatch-bound, not
  bandwidth). gemma-3-1b — the un-fused decode path runs mm_qkv (24% time) + mm_wo (15%)
  fully INLINE, 0 dispatches (fused-decode gate off for its pre/post-norm pattern);
  classifier 9% time / 30% traffic. Both are das-side dispatch-shape fixes.
- Raw logs + results page archived Mac-side; sweep rig `~/spr_sweep.sh` baked into the box
  home dir (survives in the next AMI if re-baked). gemma-4-12B / Qwen1.5-MoE GGUFs could
  not be re-fetched byte-exact — provenance hunt is a prerequisite before the AMX session.
  (RESOLVED 2026-07-05: bartowski/gemma-4-12B-it-GGUF + RichardErkhov/Qwen_-_Qwen1.5-MoE-
  A2.7B-Chat-gguf, both HEAD-verified byte-exact — the fetches lived in the wave3-gemma4
  worktree session transcripts.)

## M4 slice I — the AMX tile family (DESIGN, 2026-07-05, off-box)

**Slot scope: the batch tile only.** Scout verdict stands — TMUL is a prefill/batch family
(reg-resident 3546 GMAC/s = 22× the biased-busd512 tier; 196 GMAC/s at DRAM zero-reuse =
GEMV break-even). gemv/mm_rows slots stay vector.

**The layout is already ours.** TDPBSSD wants B[k-group][4·n+j] (VNNI 4-byte interleave) —
that is byte-for-byte the `grp<mr>` plane at mr=16: `repack_q8q8_grp` writes
`[kg][r][4 bytes]` per row-group, so one 32-k block's 8 k-groups are a contiguous 512-byte
region per group (`tileloadd64(rows=8, colsb=64, ptr=gbase + b·512, stride=64)`). ZERO new
repack. The A side tile-loads straight off the activation plane
(`tileloadd64(rows=ntok_tile, colsb=32, xqp + t0·n + b·32, stride=n)`) — no activation
repack either. AMX is s8·s8 native: **wbias must be 0** (no sign trick to delete; bias128
is busd-only).

**Per-block scale fold (the Q8_0 constraint).** Q8's fp32 scale is per 32-k block, so C
cannot accumulate i32 across blocks. K-step = ONE block (A colsb=32, B 8×64): per block,
`tdpbssd` then fold `C_i32 → acc_f32` with the rank-1 scale product (per token row t:
`acc[t][·] += cvt(C[t][·]) · (xs[t][b] ⊗ ws_vec[b])`; ws is already block-interleaved
mr-contiguous in the grp plane's scale region — one zmm load). Fold cost ≈ 1KB tilestored +
16 zmm FMAs per C tile per block vs 8192 MACs — ~3-6%. This is the same structure lcpp's
amx path uses. `tilezero` re-arms C. (Deferred fold via kstep>1 is unsound across scale
boundaries — kstep stays 1 in perm terms.)

**Macro-kernel = 2×2 tiles, exactly 8 tmm.** A0,A1 (two 16-token tiles) × B0,B1 (two
adjacent grp16 row-groups, plane offset +16·n) → C00..C11: 4 tdpbssd per 2A+2B loads —
double weight-tile reuse, 32 tok × 32 rows per k-block. Perm mapping: `dot="amx_int8"`,
mr=16 (the layout), nrsplit=2 ≙ row-group count, kstep=1 pinned; declines = new cpuid tier
`amx_int8` (leaf-7 EDX bits 24/25 tile+int8) + geometry (probe fixtures need ntok≥32 rows
d≥32). Token/row tails ride the existing generic tail machinery (scratch cap 32 holds:
token tail is per-16-token slabs).

**Enable is part of the witness.** `q8q8_family_live()` for an amx stamp: cpuid amx_int8
AND `arch_prctl(0x1023, 18) == 0` — call libc's `arch_prctl` as a JIT-resolved external
symbol (Linux-only by construction; anything else declines). Zero C++ holds:
`LLVMX86AMXTypeInContext` is bound (bindings/llvm_func.das:374), intrinsics by name via
`LLVMLookupIntrinsicID` (`llvm.x86.tileloadd64.internal`, `tdpbssd.internal`,
`tilestored64.internal`, `tilezero.internal`); the `.internal` forms use virtual tile
values — LLVM's X86 codegen-prep (x86-lower-amx-type + fast tile config) inserts
`ldtilecfg` itself under `+amx-tile,+amx-int8`. (Assumption to re-verify at emission: the
dasLLVM JIT pipeline runs codegen-prep exactly like llc — the scout numbers suggest yes.)

**The one real design fork — the plane bias conflict.** One backend = one repack: an amx
stamp needs the grp plane UNBIASED, but the current SPR winner biases it for the busd512
gemv (`gkstep2_bias128`). The batch-backend hybrid can't bridge it (biased vs plain planes
are layout-INcompatible donors). Resolution candidates, in order: (a) amx backend owns the
box with plain plane + sign-trick busd512 gemv — costs nothing IF SPR gemv is truly
bandwidth-bound (biased-vs-plain GEMV delta on SPR = **the first measurement of the AMX
session**, the slice-H logs have both rows); (b) per-slot wbias (grp plane biased, a
second UNBIASED grp16 copy of only the batch-hot tensors — memory cost); (c) per-slot
perms manifest split (ledger 5 — AMX is its forcing function either way).

**Emission gates (M1, before any silicon):** `--jit-target=x86_64-…` +
`DAS_JIT_X64_FORCE_FEATURES=+amx-int8,+amx-tile` → llc/objdump gates in
`gen_x64_emission_check.sh`: per-block loop = 1 tileloadd(A) + 1 tileloadd(B, cached across
token tiles) + tdpbssd count = tiles, 1 tilestored + 16 vcvtdq2ps/vfmadd per C per block,
ldtilecfg present once per kernel entry, ZERO vpsignb/vpabsb anywhere in the tile body.
Grid rows: amx 1×1 (probe shape) + 2×2, decline-by-design everywhere off-SPR; semantics +
tune sweep = the AMX respin session (prereq GGUFs now resolved, see above; chase target =
lcpp-AMX 135M prefill 13.3k t/s cache-resident).

### Slice I RESULTS (2026-07-05, emission M1 Max — silicon = the SPR respin session)

**Shipped as designed, emission-proven.** `dot="amx_int8"` perms (width=512, mr=16, kstep
pinned 1, bias=0, nrsplit ≙ tiles per macro side ∈ {1,2}): `emit_amx_tile` builds the TMUL
macro exactly as specified — per 32-k block nt B `tileloadd` straight off the grp16 plane
(bi·512, stride 64 — zero new repack held), nt A `tileloadd` off the activation rows
(stride n), nt² `tilezero → tdpbssd → tilestored`-to-scratch, then the 16-row cvt·ws·splat(q)
fold — with **yp as the k-loop accumulator** (registers can't hold 32×32 f32): the tile
zero-inits its own y region, which doubles as the idempotence guarantee for the wrapper's
overlapped token-tail call.

**The call-contract decision the design left open:** the 10-param tile stub is kept, but an
amx stamp covers 16·nrsplit tokens × nrsplit groups per call — so the stamp gained an
**EIGHTH companion, `q8q8_tokstep_gen()` (reference 4; amx 16·nrsplit)**, and the batch
wrapper walks (token, group) space off it: full-macro calls; token tail = ONE overlapped
macro call at `t0 = tbe−ts` (idempotent per the zero-init); batches shorter than one macro
and leftover row-groups (d 16-but-not-32-multiples) ride the vector rows-core per token
(q8q8_gemv_gen — under an amx stamp that is the busd512 lattice, so no scalar-generic cliff);
TB clamps up to one macro. Probes walk per-variant via the tokstep registry; tile fixtures
grew to ntok=32 (one full 2×2 macro, divides every other row's step).

**The plane-bias fork resolved as (a) for now:** amx stamps keep the plane UNBIASED and the
vector companions (gemv/mx4) remap `amx_int8 → vpdpbusd` (`companion_perm`) — the plain
sign-trick busd512 lattice over the same grp16/kg4 plane. The biased-vs-plain gemv delta on
SPR (slice-H logs have both rows) stays the first measurement of the silicon session; if
biased gemv matters, per-slot perms (option c) is the escalation.

**Enable-as-witness:** the amx witness emits `syscall(SYS_arch_prctl=158, 0x1023, 18) == 0`
(glibc exports no arch_prctl wrapper — libc `syscall(2)` as the JIT-resolved symbol);
perm_declines gates `g_target_os_linux` (new llvm_jit_common flag: host platform / triple OS
field) + new tier `g_target_x64_amx` (cpuid names `amx-tile`/`amx-int8` added to
das_cpu_supports, hyphen-spelled = LLVM feature spelling so force-env and llc -mattr take the
same names; XCR0 tile bits 17/18 gate them).

**Gates (all green first run, except one symbol-anchor fix):** `gen_x64_emission_check.sh`
48/48 — amx 2×2 tile = 4 tdpbssd / 4 tileloadd / 4 tilezero / 4 tilestored / 64 vcvtdq2ps /
0 sign-trick ops; 1×1 = 1/2/16; **ldtilecfg hoisted to entry + tilerelease at exit (NOT
per-block — the fast-tile-config placement question answered at llc level)**; gemv-under-amx
= 24 dots/24 abs/0 psign/0 tile ops; mx4-under-amx = 8 pshufb/8 dots; witness = 1 callq
(zero-arg witnesses carry no mangled-signature suffix — symbol anchor is '>'). All 29
pre-amx gates unchanged-green (the vector emitters are IR-untouched); arm64 emission script
unchanged-green; native test grid 44 rows green (amx rows stamp + decline to reference on
M1); jit_tests 312/312.

**Queued for the SPR respin session:** grid semantics on silicon (maxdiff vs the grp4
oracle), the enable path (witness syscall on a real kernel), tune sweep (amx vs biased
busd512 — chase lcpp-AMX 13.3k t/s 135M cache-resident prefill), the biased-vs-plain gemv
fork measurement, batch-wrapper tail/overlap validation at real prompt lengths, and
in-proc-JIT ldtilecfg placement confirmation (llc-level is entry/exit; same backend passes
should hold).

### Slice I SILICON (2026-07-05, SPR session 3, c7i.metal-24xl 8488C) — correct everywhere, kernel-iso win, END-TO-END LOSS

**Correctness: everything green on first silicon.** cpuid names live; test grid 44 rows with
all 3 amx rows LIVE, tile maxdiff 0 vs the grp4 oracle; slot parity 7/7 maxdiff 0 under an
amx manifest (incl. the ntok=5 sub-macro gemv path); oracle parity (simple_ids) Llama-1B
40/40 token-for-token under the amx stamp on BOTH a 5-token prompt (sub-macro) and a
26-token prompt (full macro + the overlapped tail — the idempotence path); suite 204/204 on
box. One REAL bug found by silicon (`2c435a39e`): the first-ever amx tune run SIGILL'd on
its first tdpbssd — tune_mode_run invoked stamped tiles directly, and the witness IS the
per-process XTILEDATA grant (test mode was green only because its lockstep checks invoke
every witness). Production is safe (selection evaluates the witness); the harness now
consumes witnesses up front.

**Tune sweep (single-core, d=512 fixture): amx WINS kernel-iso** — 1×1 macro 191.2 GMAC/s /
2×2 157.9 vs biased busd512 156.4 (+22% for 1×1; note 191 ≈ the scout's DRAM-fed ceiling
196, i.e. the fixture regime is memory-fed, not the 3546 ALU regime).

**End-to-end (emission_bench, T24): amx LOSES — badly.** 135M pp 5477 (biased busd512) vs
3259 (amx 1×1) / 2462 (2×2); 1B pp 2413 vs 979/1080. T8 discriminator (1B): 0.64× vs 0.41×
at T24 ⇒ the loss is BOTH structural (~1.6× at low T) and scaling-amplified (AMX frequency
license / memory contention at 24C). The production regime is DRAM-streamed and
fold-bounded — TMUL's ALU advantage has nothing to cash against (consistent with lcpp-AMX
shining only cache-resident). **Verdict: the amx leg stays grid-resident; biased busd512
keeps the SPR manifest.** Do not revisit end-to-end amx on SPR without a structural change
(deeper B-residency / cache-resident scheduling); next look = a different AMX box class
(Granite Rapids) or the cache-resident-serving regime.

**The bias fork (first measurement, single bracket, both gkstep2 — the clean A/B):** biased
busd512 beats plain +2.6% emit / +26% pp (1B), +8.0% emit / +18% pp (0.6B). bias128 pays on
BOTH sides, so fork option (a) costs real decode under an amx stamp — moot on SPR (amx isn't
the driver), but per-slot perms remains the escalation if any box ever flips the amx
end-to-end verdict.

**🔑 TUNE-METHODOLOGY FINDING (needs a decision):** the single-core tile microbench CROWNED
amx nrsplit1 — `tune_for_this_box` on SPR would write a manifest that loses ~2× end-to-end.
First-ever divergence between the tune fixture regime (1-core, cache-warm reps) and
production (multi-core, DRAM-streamed); vector rows never diverged. Candidate fixes:
a multi-core/streaming tune leg, an end-to-end confirm pass in the tuner, or an eligibility
rail demoting tile-family rows that need cache residency.

**→ RESOLVED (2026-07-05, Boris picked the e2e confirm pass; SHIPPED same day):**
`tune_mode_run` no longer writes a divergent crown blind. After the merged winner is picked:
(1) a compile-only child (`GEN_TUNE_COMPILE_ONLY=1`, `DAS_TUNE_MODE=normal`, no manifest)
prints the `llvm_tune: q8q8_tile_gen <- … (fallback)` stamp line — the per-ISA fallback this
box would resolve to; (2) winner == fallback ⇒ write as before (the common case, zero new
cost beyond the child compile); (3) winner ≠ fallback ⇒ the challenger must BEAT the fallback
in a real-model prefill A/B — `harness/tune_confirm_prefill.das` children (512-tok synthetic
prefill, production stamps + box_profile knobs, `_jit_fast_math` parity), interleaved F/W ×2
best-of, challenger needs > ×1.02, wrong-stamp or crashing child scores 0 (a SIGILL-ing
manifest-forced stamp = a rejection, by construction) — winner confirmed ⇒ written, else the
FALLBACK is pinned explicitly (clears stale entries). No `DASLLAMA_CONFIRM_MODEL` env set ⇒
the divergent crown is NOT written and the run says how to confirm. First live run (M1 Max,
135M): the microbench crowned `kstep4_nrsplit2_mr8_gkstep4` (the slice-B +3.3% iso shape) but
e2e it made only +2.0% (4328 vs 4244) — under the bar, kstep2 pinned. The guard bites on its
first outing: iso wins shrink e2e, and sub-2% doesn't displace a fleet-proven default. On SPR
this same pass would have rejected the amx crown at ~0.5× emphatically.

**The arch ladder (Boris's ask, same session — full CSV in the session scratchpad):** 4 models
× 3 ISA tiers × both engines × T{8,24}, both engines genuinely tier-limited (das: explicit
host-triple + DAS_JIT_X64_FORCE_FEATURES + per-tier manifest — the cross-triple rail executes
natively, proven; lcpp: per-tier clang builds, amx = native). pp512 @T24, avx2→vnni→amx:
das 1952→3058→1237 / lcpp 1378→1781→3387 (0.6B); das 1268→2369→1314 / lcpp 861→904→2556 (1B);
das 1276→1931→897 / lcpp 989→1197→2874 (gemma-3-1b); das 338→688→324 / lcpp 228→259→716 (4B).
READING: the engines climb in different places — das gains 1.9-2.4× from the VNNI step
(bias128 busd512) and nothing from amx; lcpp gains 1.1-1.3× from VNNI and 2.3-2.9× ONLY from
the AMX unit. **das-on-VNNI ≈ lcpp-on-AMX within 8-15% on 3 of 4 models** (gemma = their
standout amx case, 1.49×); same-tier head-to-head das wins prefill 1.4-2.8× everywhere.
Decode is tier-insensitive for both (bandwidth-bound); lcpp's amx-build +11-15% emit is the
packed VNNI weight LAYOUT feeding their m=1 vector fast path, not tile ops. das ladder emit
carries a ~13% generic-CPU-scheduling handicap (no -mcpu on cross triples) — within-engine
shape honest, cross-engine decode ratios come from native runs (session-2 sweep: parity-ish).

**lcpp AMX source read (why theirs wins where it wins; mmq.cpp):** same 2×2 macro geometry,
same per-block C spill + fold — but the fold is SOFTWARE-PIPELINED (double-buffered C scratch,
block i−1's AVX-512 fold interleaves between block i's TMUL ops, :2015-2105), ldtilecfg is
thread_local once-per-thread, decode never touches tiles (m=1 = vnni fast path over the
packed layout), and their GENERIC path chunks matmuls 2-D (out-rows × tokens, rows-fastest
linearization, ggml-cpu.c:1388-1442) — the chunk-starved-shape remedy now on OUR ledger
(2-D batch chunk space; amx fold pipelining ledgered as conditional).

**Flash-decode deep-ctx on SPR (the queued zen2 soft-spot check):** Qwen3-0.6B ctx2048 T24
emit 79.4 fused vs 50.6 per-op = **+57%** — zen2's −5% does not reproduce; SPR follows M1's
direction with margin. (The env rail toggles the whole chain — a FLASH_DECODE_SLICE env for
slice-only A/Bs is a ledger nit.)

## M4 slice J — the smmla leg (dot="smmla", i8mm; DESIGN 2026-07-05)

**Slot scope: the batch tile.** SMMLA is a 2×2 MMA — `acc[i][j] += a_row_i · b_row_j` over 8
k-bytes, 32 MACs/instr, no horizontal reduce; the M3 scout measured 2.21× sdot4 GMAC/s
register-resident ([[dasllama-m3-air-box]]). The 2×2 shape needs two tokens per A operand, so
the tile (nrsplit 2/4, both even) is the natural client; the GEMV slot (one token) would waste
half the MMA and stays on the sdot lattice.

**The layout is NOT ours this time — kgroup=8.** smmla's B operand is a ROW-PAIR × 8 k-bytes
in one q-reg; the grp<mr> plane's dword groups ([kg4][r][4b]) put those bytes in four places.
Marshalling in-kernel (zip per weight vector, no reuse across anything but the 2 token pairs)
costs ≈ the MMA advantage — counted it: mr8 break-even, mr4 worse. So the perm carries a
second layout axis: **kgroup** — bytes per row per k-group. kg8 = `[kg8][r][8 bytes]`, B
operands become straight 16-byte loads (the scout probe's exact layout), and the marshalling
moves to load-time repack where it belongs. `Q8RepackType` gains `kgroup` (4 default), the
stamp gains a SEVENTH companion (`q8q8_kgroup_gen`, reference body 4), and the runtime repack /
token-tail generic / mx4→Q8 expand map all branch on it. The batch wrapper's mr==4 laneq token
tail additionally gates on kgroup==4 (an smmla mr4 stamp's plane is kg8 — the generic tail
reads it instead).

**The block emitter (emit_block_smmla).** Per 32-k block: 4·(mr/2) straight B loads
(`bi·mr·32 + g·8·mr + rp·16`); A operands from the token chunk loads via 4 byte-shuffles per
token pair (zip1/zip2.2d shapes — `[0..7,16..23]` / `[8..15,24..31]` masks, reused across all
row pairs); MMA lattice `m[tp][rp] = smmla(m[tp][rp], A[tp][g], B[g][rp])`; then a per-block
2-shuffle i32 transpose per (token pair, row quad) — `[0,1,4,5]`/`[2,3,6,7]` = uzp1/uzp2.2d —
back into the token-major `a[token][rowquad]` accumulators, so the per-block scale fold and
the store machinery are byte-for-byte the existing ones (fold order preserved → the one grp4
oracle still serves). Register budget is the sdot formula unchanged (w 2mr + acc nrsplit·mr/4
+ act 2·nrsplit + 2): smmla admits exactly the sdot (mr, nrsplit) space — mr4/nr4 22,
mr8/nr2 26 regs. Op-count sizing per mr8/nr2 block: 16 B loads + 4 x loads + 4 zips +
16 smmla + 4 uzp vs sdot's 20 loads + 32 sdot — ~1.3-1.4× ALU-side expected at the kernel
(the 2.21× is the no-marshalling ceiling; fold + A-pairing eat the rest). A-side pre-pairing
at quantize time would drop the 4 zips — ledger, only if silicon says the zips show.

**Companions under an smmla perm.** GEMV: sdot lattice over the kg8 plane — per (kg8 g,
row quad): two pair-loads + uzp1/uzp2.4s reassemble the two kg4-shaped sdot vectors
(`[r0k0-3,r1k0-3,r2k0-3,r3k0-3]`), the lattice above the loads untouched; GEMV is DRAM-bound,
the extra uzp is hidden. mx4: the nibble plane is kgroup-independent ([j][r][4b], its own
repack) — the mx4 emitter forces the sdot lattice (i8mm implies dotprod), zero change. wbias:
smmla is s8·s8 native, bias128 declines (vpdpbusd-only rail already says so).

**Declines (the shared predicate, one new leg):** dot="smmla" → aarch64 + width 128 + mr%4==0
(row-quad transpose + gemv fixup) + bias==0 + **g_target_arm64_i8mm** + smmla intrinsic decl
(+ tbl1, the mx4 lockstep rail). The new tier flag: host targets read
`LLVMGetHostCPUFeatures()` for "+i8mm" (populated on Linux aarch64) OR'd with
DAS_JIT_ARM64_FORCE_FEATURES (the macOS story — LLVM's host-features string is empty there, so
the env is the rail on Apple silicon, same string on emitter box and target box = DLL cache
key match, the slice's whole no-linker-on-target recipe). `requires = "i8mm"` eligibility in
the fallback chain reads both env rails (llvm_tune is macro-context — no cpuid for arm, the
env IS the truth there).

**Gates.** M1 cannot execute smmla (dotprod only): emission proof =
`gen_arm64_emission_check.sh` (the slice F script's arm64 twin — native triple + forced
+i8mm, compile-only + --jit-dump → llc -mattr=+dotprod,+i8mm → objdump; per-variant gates:
tile smmla counts exact (mr8/nr2/kstep2 = 96), zero sdot in the smmla tile body, gemv = sdot
16 + uzp 16 + zero smmla, mx4 rides tbl). Semantics + tune = the M3 Air (`ssh air`,
[[dasllama-m3-air-box]] recipe: compile grid on M1 under the forced env, rsync
.jitted_scripts + sources, cache-hit there). kg8 repack + generic-dot correctness is pure das
— unit-tested on M1 (no i8mm needed). Fallback-chain promotion (`dot_smmla_…;kstep2` with
requires="i8mm") waits for the Air tune verdict, same discipline as bias128.

### Slice J RESULTS (2026-07-05, emission M1 Max / silicon M3 Air)

**Shipped as designed**: kgroup axis end-to-end (schema + 7th companion + repack + token
generic + batch-tail gate + mx4→Q8 expand remap + tune-probe lockstep + KernelBackend cache),
DOT_SMMLA emitter, kg8 sdot fixup, `g_target_arm64_i8mm`, `GEN_TUNE_COMPILE_ONLY` mint gate.
M1: emission gates ALL GREEN (tile mr8 = 96 smmla / 0 sdot, mr4 = 48/0; gemv 16 sdot + the
kg8 fixup folded to **ld2.4s structured de-interleave loads** (7 ld2 + 1 uzp pair = 16
vectors — better than the predicted 8 uzp pairs, the de-interleave rides the load unit; the
gate checks the invariant 2·ld2+uzp1+uzp2 == 16); tile body histogram exactly the design
budget: 96 smmla + 24 zip2.2d + 24 mov.d A-pairs (4/block) + fold). x64 emission gates
unchanged-green (the emit_block/fold refactor is IR-neutral); suite 204/204 (+4:
test_kgroup_repack), jit_tests 312/312, gen_tune_probe test grid green with all 5 smmla rows
declining to ref on M1.

**M3 Air silicon**: grid test — all 5 smmla rows LIVE on kg8 planes, tile maxdiff 0 vs the
grp4 oracle (kstep2 rows bit-exact), gemv/mx4 in tolerance; the no-linker cache-hit recipe
worked (one DLL serves test+tune — the grid stamps identically in both modes). Tune table
(single-core, interleaved best-of-6, no thermal gradient — the ~106 reference rows are flat
across the run):

| family | tile (n2048 d512 t64) | gemv hot | gemv stream |
|---|---|---|---|
| sdot kstep2 (mr4, M1's default) | 159.0 | 85.6 | 59.7 |
| **sdot kstep2_nrsplit2_mr8 (air winner)** | **162.9** | **91.2** | 59.7 |
| smmla mr8_kstep2_nrsplit2 (best MMA row) | 130.6 | 84.3 | 59.5 |
| reference / declined x64 rows | ~106 | ~85.6 | ~59.7 |

**Verdict — M3 runs smmla on ONE NEON pipe.** 130.6 GMAC/s ÷ 32 MACs = 4.08 G MMA/s ≈ 1/cyc
at the ~4.05 GHz P-core: the tile sits at **100% of the 1-pipe MMA ceiling** (marshalling
fully hidden — the emitter has nothing left to give), while sdot issues ~2.45/cyc across 4
pipes. 1 pipe × 32 MACs < 4 pipes × 16 MACs, structurally. The scout's 2.21× was the
LOAD-BOUND ratio (half the byte traffic per MAC at equal loads), not ALU truth — the tile
amortizes loads differently and the pipe asymmetry dominates. **No fallback-chain change**
(sdot keeps arm64; the air box manifest crowned `kstep2_nrsplit2_mr8` — an sdot row). The
smmla leg stays grid-resident + requires="i8mm"-gated for server arm64 (Neoverse V1/V2 /
Graviton3+ issue smmla 2-4/cyc — there the same stamp should flip the verdict; the tune
framework decides per box, which is the whole point).

Air-box operational gotchas recorded in [[dasllama-m3-air-box]]: `modules/dasLLAMA/.das_module`
is a DOTFILE — a `rsync dir1 dir2` ship misses it and every `dasllama/*` require fails
"file not found" (ship it explicitly); `-dasroot` doesn't substitute for it.

## M4 slice K — the AMX fair shot (PLANNED 2026-07-05, Boris; build post-/clear)

**The call (Boris): the pipelined fold is THE bet — "if I were to do 1 thing, I would do
this". Not budget-constrained; the discipline is single-variable clarity over gradient
search — every item lands as an independently toggleable arm so each on-box number names
its cause.** Source truth re-read 2026-07-05 (lcpp mmq.cpp); four deltas vs our slice-I leg:

- **I4 — software-pipelined fold (build FIRST, the bet).** lcpp mmq.cpp:2008-2105:
  double-buffered C scratch (TileC0/C1 swap), block i−1's AVX-512 i32→f32 scale fold
  interleaved BETWEEN block i's tdpbssd ops — vector ports fold while TMUL crunches. Same
  fold cadence as ours (their TILE_K=32 = one Q8 block = our kstep 1); ours simply stalls
  TMUL during every fold. Delivery: additional `[tune_perm]` rows (`…_pipelined`), NOT a
  rewrite of the serial rows — the grid A/Bs serial-vs-pipelined on-box as a pure
  single-variable comparison, and the e2e confirm pass guards the crown. Upside is ON TOP
  of the 1-core win (191 vs 156 already absorbed the serial-fold cost).
- **I1 — tile-config latch.** lcpp mmq.cpp:204: `thread_local bool done`, ldtilecfg once
  per thread, NO tilerelease anywhere. Ours: cfg+release per macro call — the release
  forfeits TMUL state and may bounce the AMX frequency license; invisible at 1 core,
  compounds at T24. Emitter: thread-local once-latch, drop tilerelease. Small.
- **I2 — 2-D grid on the amx arm.** lcpp mmq.cpp:2472: MB×NB grid of 32-tok × 32-row
  blocks, flattened (even balance211 split suffices at that density). Our amx arm is 1-D
  over ngu=ng/gs — 135M qkv = 18 chunks for 48 lanes, twice as starved as the vector walk
  the batch_grid_2d work just fixed. Mechanical: extend matmul_grid + cell decode to the
  ts≠4 walk (ts-token × gs-group cells); rides the same batch_grid_2d pin. Small.
- **I3 — biased-plane unification (kills the slice-I bias fork).** lcpp packs ONE buffer
  serving both regimes: s8s8 tiles + per-block compensation row (s8s8_compensation :770)
  so m=1 rides u8s8 VNNI. Our mirror: plane w^0x80 (bias128), tile fold subtracts 128·bsum
  in the FOLD STAGE (xbsp is already the tile's 10th param; keep tilezero — pure AVX-512
  arithmetic on the C scratch), companions remap to BIASED busd. One plane, both slots
  optimal; the measured plain-busd gemv penalty under an amx stamp (+2.6-8% emit,
  +18-26% pp on the busd A/B) goes away. Medium.
- (noted, deferred: lcpp M∈2..15 = tile sub-blocks, M==1 = 64-row VNNI walk; our
  short-batch per-token gemv fallback is the only remaining gap — minor.)

**Build order: I4 → I1 → I2 → I3, all emission-proven on M1 first** (x64 emission check
counts + native grid maxdiff + suite + oracle parity — amx rows decline on M1, emission
gates still prove the asm). **Then the SPR respin (ami-067fe7f4a0b6c2be5), on box until
we're happy:** P1 frequency probe (turbostat: das-amx / das-vnni / lcpp-amx @T24 — decompose
the license component of the 1-core-win/e2e-loss inversion); P2 dispatch probe (team-prof +
per-op on an amx-stamped pp run — quantify the 18-chunk starvation); then the A/B ladder —
each arm in isolation, then cumulative — re-run the arch-ladder row, flip or permanently
close the amx verdict with attributable data. Piggyback: vector-walk batch_grid_2d pin A/B
(zen2 winner = wave-aligned knob 2), the confirm pass's SPR outing, and bake a FRESH AMI at
session end (box_profile + simple_ids + manifest included — session 3's died with the
instance).

### Slice K BUILT (2026-07-05, M1 emission-proven — silicon adjudication = the SPR respin)

All four arms landed as independently toggleable perm axes; the serial slice-I rows are
byte-identical controls. New grid rows: `…nrsplit2_pipe1`, `…nrsplit2_latch1`,
`…nrsplit2_bias128` (isolation) + `…nrsplit2_pipe1_latch1_bias128` (cumulative). Gates:
x64 emission 81/81 (llc cross-compile counts), arm64 emission unchanged-green, M1 native
grid 48 rows lockstep (all 4 new rows decline cleanly off-silicon), suite + 1B parity green.

- **I4 `pipe=1`** — double-buffered C spill (2×nt² tile regions, one alloca), peel block 0
  compute-only, steady-state loop folds block bi−1 from C[pre] textually between block bi's
  tile ops (buffer swap via head phis; exit block folds the final spill off the post-swap
  cPre). Emission: 8 tdpbssd / 8 loads / 8 zero / 8 spill / 128 fold cvts; disasm shows
  ~115 vector-fold instructions sitting between consecutive tdpbssd chains — the lcpp
  cadence (mmq.cpp:2008-2105) verbatim.
- **I1 `latch=1`** — implemented as the RAW immediate-tmm intrinsics (`llvm.x86.tdpbssd`
  etc.), NOT the `.internal` SSA form: the backend's fast-tile-config insertion
  (entry ldtilecfg + exit tilerelease) has no C-API off-switch, and raw ops are exactly
  lcpp's user-managed mode. Fixed register plan C=tmm0-3 (r·nt+ts) / A=tmm4-5 / B=tmm6-7 —
  bonus over `.internal`: LLVM's RA was serializing all four C chains through one tmm4.
  Config = NINTH companion `q8q8_amx_cfg_gen` (`() : void`; latch rows emit one LDTILECFG
  of a 64-byte private-constant palette, every other row a bare ret), called by the batch
  wrapper ONCE PER CHUNK — per-chunk beats a thread-local latch on plumbing (no TLS-in-JIT
  risk, no worker identity needed) and amortizes identically. 🔑 harness trap found: an
  `.internal` amx row TILERELEASEs at exit, so a latch row invoked after it faults with no
  palette — gen_tune_probe now invokes the row's cfg companion before EVERY direct tile
  sweep (test + tune legs).
- **I2** — the amx ts≠4 arm now rides `matmul_grid` (units = ngu, unit_rows = gs·mr,
  tokq = ts) behind the same batch_grid_2d pin; shared `q8q8_batch_amx_cell_gen` walk
  (1-D arm = old body verbatim with the full token range). Tail rule made cell-safe: the
  overlapped tail macro fires only when `tbe − ts >= tb0` (identical to the old absolute
  check at tb0=0), so an overlap can never reach into a concurrent cell's token range —
  race-free by construction, no reliance on division proofs.
- **I3 `bias=128`** — the dot is **TDPBSUD** (signed A tiles × unsigned w^0x80 B plane):
  feeding biased bytes to TDPBSSD is NOT linearly correctable (s8 reinterpretation of
  w^0x80 is w±128 piecewise by sign), but SU-order is Σw·x + 128·Σx exactly, and the
  existing xbsp bsums plane (−128·Σx i32) lands in the FOLD stage as one embedded-broadcast
  vpaddd per row before the cvt (tilezero untouched). Companions inherit bias through
  companion_perm → the gemv rides the BIASED busd512 lattice (9 dots = 8 + inline bsum,
  zero sign ops) — the slice-I fork's measured gemv penalty (+2.6-8% emit, +18-26% pp)
  is gone. mx4 companion already forces bias=0 internally (nibble plane never biased).

SPR protocol unchanged (P1/P2 probes first, per-arm ladder, cumulative, arch-ladder re-run,
AMI bake). Note for the ladder: `latch` and `bias` change the GEMV/companion side too — the
kernel-iso A/B attributes the tile, emission_bench attributes the family.

### Slice K SILICON — SPR session 4 (2026-07-05): the fair shot answered, amx CLOSED

Boris re-shaped the protocol on entry: full pin sweep on the arch-ladder models, one model
first, sanity before everything. Executed as: pairwise rows added (`c0ff31896` — pipe1_latch1
/ pipe1_bias128 / latch1_bias128 complete the 2^3 tile lattice; emission gates 100/100, M1
grid 51 rows decline-clean) → box sanity (suite 213/213, grid 51 rows LIVE incl. all four
bias128-amx rows at 3.8e-06 = sanctioned fold-order tolerance, slot parity 7/7, oracle parity
40/40 ×3 incl. amx-cumulative + grid-on) → Llama-1B @T24 full lattice (10 rows × grid{0,2} ×
2 reps, 40 cells, zero failures, every cell stamp-verified) → condensed lattice on
Qwen3-0.6B / gemma-3-1b / Qwen3-4B.

**Verdict: amx < vnni everywhere — 0.36–0.55× the biased-busd512 champion across all four
models; the best cell ever (pipe1_latch1 on Qwen3-0.6B, 0.55×) is below the plain AVX2
maddubs tier. The family stays grid-resident; spr_manifest unchanged. Arc CLOSED.**

The decomposition (no mysteries left):

- **Codegen exonerated** (Boris's "llvm producing god knows what" check): objdump of the
  production JIT DLL (the sweep cells' own artifact) shows exactly the designed shape —
  pipelined 2×2 macro (8 loads / 8 dots / 8 zero / 8 spill), raw tmm on the fixed C=tmm0-3
  / A=tmm4-5 / B=tmm6-7 plan, ONE ldtilecfg in the whole object (the cfg companion), rolled
  k-loop (single back-branch), ~115-165 fold insns between dot chains = the lcpp cadence.
  Box-JIT output ≡ the M1 llc-cross gates.
- **Frequency license exonerated** (P1 turbostat, bench-phase-anchored): das-amx 3745 MHz ≡
  das-vnni 3730 MHz @T24 — our tile density never leaves the vector license class. lcpp-amx
  drops to 3322 MHz (−11%) and still wins 2.7× — they pay the license and win anyway.
- **Dispatch mostly exonerated** (P2, the new `DASLLAMA_TEAM_PROF` rail in prefill_perf,
  `0719968ed`): publish 528ns/op (negligible), join-tail 283µs vs vnni's 29µs ≈ 10-15% of op
  time (coarse 32-token units → ragged waves) — real but secondary.
- **The bill: serve 2.28×** (1125µs vs 493µs per op, N=512 — the chunk kernels themselves).
  Structural root = the kstep=1 Q8-scale-boundary fold: every 32-k block spills all four C
  tiles and folds on vector ports — ~256KB C-spill traffic per 32-row × 32-token unit vs
  64KB of weight traffic, ~960 instructions per k-iteration wrapping 4 tdpbsud. The TMUL
  idles behind the fold; no pin reorganizes that away.

Pin attribution: pipe1_latch1 is the one real arm — +15% kernel-iso 1-core (105.5 vs 92.1
GMAC/s; raw tmm undoes LLVM's serialized-tmm4 chain, THEN pipelining pays — the slice-K bet,
correct within the family) and +34% e2e on deep-thin Qwen3-0.6B; flat inside the noise band
on the other three. bias128-on-amx = net e2e LOSS on every model (the fold gains one vpaddd
per element; the biased gemv side doesn't recoup it) — the slice-I plane-bias fork's option
(a) stands. amx run-to-run variance ±14% (same stamp, same grid) vs champion ±0.7% — the
fragility itself is a verdict: the family is hypersensitive to warm-up/claim order, the
champion is unconditionally robust.

Also this session: **e2e confirm pass first SPR outing** — tune mode 1-core crowned amx
nrsplit1 (174 GMAC/s on the d=32 fixture), confirm child measured 0.49× e2e, REJECTED,
fallback pinned — the session-3 methodology hole closed on the box that exposed it.
**batch_grid_2d SPR verdict: no pin** — 135M @T48 champ interleaved ×2: grid2 within ±1%,
grid1 −5% (zen2's +8-15% does NOT transfer; SPR's 1-D chunk counts already fill 48 lanes on
the vector walk). SPR box_profile stays {65536, 48, 0, team_rank_gate:1}. JIT-cache nit for
the ledger: the artifact GC keeps one DLL per namespace, so alternating stamps recompile
every run (~60-90s/cell tax on sweeps; correctness unaffected).

Ledger (conditional, not queued): **amx kstep=2 fold** — K=64 tiles folding two scale
segments per spill halves the C traffic; honest ceiling ≈ 1.6× behind the champion, so it
only matters if a future box inverts the fold/TMUL cost ratio.

## Direction (Boris, 2026-07-04, post slice B) — the deletion is the mandate, not a maybe

Get rid of the hand-written kernels **apart from the default ones** (the portable /
row-major auto-select tiers stay as the correct-everywhere floor), and work on the tune
kernels **until everything is wonderful on all supported architectures**. The generated
`[tune]` family is THE path — hand tiers don't wait for a per-tier scoreboard verdict; they
get replaced as family coverage lands. What that implies, in order:

1. **Slice C — promote the gen backend on arm64**: the generated family stops being
   probe-only; fleet re-sweep (emission_bench pp512) with the mr8 winner stamped, then the
   gen backend supersedes arm64-laneq as the load-select tier.
2. **Coverage the deletion needs** (each a [tune] family or a layout-driven das traversal
   over generated cores): GEMV sub-family (nr=1, latency-shaped — replaces laneq mm/mm_rows),
   group3/groupN traversals, the mx4 family (MXFP4 kernels — the second quant family), token
   tails.
3. **x64 legs**: vpdpbusd/maddubs/vpdpbssd dot emitters + width/tail perms — replaces the
   whole AVX kernel matrix (history/dasLLAMA/avx_kernel_matrix.md). Zen2 desktop first, EPYC for zvnni.
4. **Delete**: arm64-laneq tier, x64 AVX matrix tiers, dasllama_tune's [tuned]/box_profile
   rail (subsumed by the loop-hint manifest kind), keeping portable/default backends only.

**Still open in M4 proper:** loop-hint manifest kind; per-slot perms. (Slices C–F above
delivered the promote, the GEMV/mx4 coverage, and the emission-proven x64 dot emitters; the
x64 runtime bring-up — witness companion, registration, silicon gates — is the queued Zen2/
EPYC session, slice F section above.)
