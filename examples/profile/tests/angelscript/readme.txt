this is version just copied from https://github.com/r-lyeh-archived/scriptorium with added AddOne function to test natives
the results are so poor (twice slower than squirrel for all tests here for both jit\and non jit version, except native which has almost the same speed as squirrel) that I do not bother to make a profile
And that seems much harder also with weird usage functions as parameters
to compile - check make.bat and clone angelscript
