This tutorial demonstrates how to setup AOT infrastructure for projects with custom modules.
CMakeLists.txt has details in tutorial02aot section

Typically setting up project for AOT can be accomplished in 3 steps.

0. Module needs to be setup as separate compilation unit or collection of includes.
    Additionally module needs to specify aotRequire include and aot type.
    See tutorial02module.cpp for details.
    This step can be fully accomplished without any other project modifications.

1. Setup AOT utility.
    All custom modules needs to be available for the AOT utility.
    For that we setup custom AOT utility executable.
    See tutorial02_dasaot.cpp for details.

2. Setup AOT target.
    This is pure 'project setup' set to ensure that .das files are converted to .das.cpp files.
    This step calls our custom dasAot utility and performs the conversion.
    See CMakeLists.txt for details.

3. Setup main tutorial executable.
    results of the step 2 (in form of .das.cpp files) need to be compiled and linked with the application
    Ahead-of-time functions need to be linked to the context after the simulation stage
    See tutorial02aot.cpp for details
