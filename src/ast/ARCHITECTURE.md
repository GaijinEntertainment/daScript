# src/ast - the front end's AST

Contract: `ARCHITECTURE_COMMON.md` (repo root). This document carries the mechanisms of this
folder that a rule cites. The folder's other subsystems - parsing, inference, simulation - are
described in `skills/internal/cpp_codebase_notes.md` (repo-only).

## 1. The module-cache read in `trySerializeProgramModule` (`ast_parse.cpp`)

The front end parses modules in require order. When a module cache is installed
(`ModuleFileCache`), each module first tries `trySerializeProgramModule`. The reader stands at
the next record and checks that the record names this file, that the size and content hash of
the bytes the compile's `FileAccess` serves for that name match (never a stat, so a file that is
not on disk under that name is covered, and a rewrite that leaves the bytes alone serves), and
that every compile-time input the record's macros pinned
(`add_module_cache_dependency` - a file's bytes, an environment variable's value under
`env:NAME`, a command-line flag's occurrences under `arg:--flag`) still has the same content. A
match deserializes the module and counts it as served; the module object is a `ModuleDas`, the
class the parser builds, because the AOT emitter asks each module whether it can be AOT'd and a
plain `Module` answers no. A served module's file record carries the file's name and length,
not its text; the reader resolves the name through the compile's `FileAccess` - the file system,
`.das_project` hook or in-memory access a parse would have gone through - and every line
reference in the module points at the object the access returns, source included, so a lint
reading a `nolint:` marker or an error printing a source line sees the bytes the access serves.
The module takes its own file from the access the way a parse leaves it (`letGoOfFileInfo`);
a name the access cannot produce keeps the record's source-less object. The record also carries
the `CodeOfPolicies` of the compile that wrote it, and a record whose policies differ from the
reading compile's is never served - a lint compile and a run compile of one graph never share a
record. The mismatch fails the record the way damage does, reparsed in place rather than cutting
the stream (damage landing on the policy bytes must not cut it either), and the writeback that
repairs it carries the new policies. The first mismatch is the cutoff: the reader marks the stream failed, the
module and everything after it parse from source, and the writer rewrites the whole file - the
served records re-serialized from the modules the reader restored, then the freshly parsed
ones. A record whose header matched but whose payload fails to deserialize reparses in place,
without cutting the stream, whenever the record carries a usable payload length.

Every diagnostic the read prints - a record for another file, a changed file, a changed
dependency, changed policies, a truncated or version-mismatched stream, a failed payload, a
reparse in place - is
gated on the serializer's `quietCache`. The host sets that flag for the default cache, which is
on unasked for an ordinary run; ungated, each of those lines would be output every user sees on
an ordinary edit. An explicit `-module-cache` leaves the flag off, so those runs get the lines
together with the host's verdict.
