The BITFIELD_TRAIT module implements reflection utilities for bitfield types:
converting bitfield values to and from human-readable strings, iterating
over individual set bits, and constructing bitfield values from string names.

All functions and symbols are in "bitfield_trait" module, use require to get access to it. ::

    require daslib/bitfield_trait
