The JSON module implements JSON parsing and serialization.
It provides ``read_json`` for parsing JSON text into a ``JsonValue`` tree,
``write_json`` for serializing back to text, and ``JV`` helpers for constructing
JSON values from daScript types.

See also :doc:`json_boost` for automatic struct-to-JSON conversion and the ``%json~`` reader macro.

All functions and symbols are in "json" module, use require to get access to it. ::

    require daslib/json

Example: ::

    require daslib/json

        [export]
        def main() {
            let data = "[1, 2, 3]"
            var error = ""
            var js <- read_json(data, error)
            print("json: {write_json(js)}\n")
            unsafe {
                delete js
            }
        }
        // output:
        // json: [1,2,3]
