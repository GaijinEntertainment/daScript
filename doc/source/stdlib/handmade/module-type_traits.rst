The TYPE_TRAITS module provides compile-time type introspection and manipulation.
It includes type queries (``is_numeric``, ``is_string``, ``is_pointer``),
type transformations, and generic programming utilities for writing
type-aware macros and functions.

All functions and symbols are in "type_traits" module, use require to get access to it. ::
