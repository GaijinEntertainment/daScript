The PROFILER module provides CPU profiling infrastructure for measuring
function execution times. It includes instrumentation-based profiling with
hierarchical call tracking and timing statistics.

See also :doc:`profiler_boost` for cross-context profiler control and scoped timing macros.

All functions and symbols are in "profiler" module, use require to get access to it.
