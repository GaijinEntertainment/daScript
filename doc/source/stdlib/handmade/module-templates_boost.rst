The TEMPLATES_BOOST module extends template utilities with high-level macros
for common code generation patterns, including template function generation,
type-parameterized struct creation, and compile-time code expansion.

See also :doc:`templates` for ``decltype`` and ``[template]`` annotations.

All functions and symbols are in "templates_boost" module, use require to get access to it.
