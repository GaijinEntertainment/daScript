The TYPEMACRO_BOOST module provides infrastructure for defining type macros —
custom compile-time type transformations. Type macros allow introducing new
type syntax that expands into standard daScript types during compilation.

All functions and symbols are in "typemacro_boost" module, use require to get access to it. ::

    require daslib/typemacro_boost
