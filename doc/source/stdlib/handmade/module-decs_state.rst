The DECS_STATE module extends DECS with state machine support for entities.
It provides state transition management, allowing entities to change behavior
based on their current state.

See also :doc:`decs` for the core ECS runtime and :doc:`decs_boost` for query macros.
See :ref:`tutorial_decs` for a hands-on tutorial.

All functions and symbols are in "decs_state" module, use require to get access to it.
