Compiles a regular expression pattern string into an existing ``Regex`` object. Returns ``true`` on success. When ``case_insensitive`` is true, matching ignores ASCII case. When ``dot_all`` is true, ``.`` also matches newline characters. Validity of the compiled expression is checked by ``is_valid``.
