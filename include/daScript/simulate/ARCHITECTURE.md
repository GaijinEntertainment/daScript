# Simulate headers - architecture notes

## The hot-path model

The interpreter's throughput is a handful of functions: the `SimNode::eval*` methods
(`simulate_nodes.h`, `runtime_*.h`, the extern-call nodes in `interop.h`), their AOT twins
in `aot.h`, and the dispatchers
`Context::callOrFastcall` / `callWithCopyOnReturn` / `invoke` / `invokeEx` (`simulate.h`).
Work added there runs once per evaluated node, so a single load, branch, or counter taxes
every program on every step. Amortized container work - growth in `src/simulate/runtime_array.cpp`
(repo root) / `runtime_table.h`, reached from eval nodes but running once per capacity change - is outside
the hot set; its cost is judged against the allocate/copy/rehash it rides.

## Table key hashing

A table key hashes on every rail as the interpreter's table node hashes it. A builtin key type -
`heap.h`'s `makeTableKeyValueNode` list: scalars, the vectors, the ranges, strings, pointers -
hashes as itself, `hash_function(context, key)`: `hash_uint32`/`hash_uint64` for the scalar and
range specializations, `hash_blockz64` for strings, `hash_block64` over `sizeof(key)` bytes
otherwise (8 for an `int2`, 12 for a `float3`). A handled key - a `ManagedValueAnnotation<OT>`
such as `Time` or a module's id type - hashes as its workhorse, `WrapType<OT>::type`, because
that is the das value type the annotation declares (`makeValueType`) and what the compiler casts
the key to before the node hashes it; `EntityId` hashes as an `int32`, `BigEntityId` as a
`vec4f`. The interpreter's table nodes (`runtime_table_nodes.h`), the JIT helpers
(`src/builtin/module_jit.cpp`, repo root), the JSON scanner (`src/simulate/json_scan.cpp`, repo
root), rtti and the C API call `hash_function` on the key type they hold. `KeyHash`
(`runtime_table.h`) is the same hash for the callers that hold a key of a C++ type - AOT's
`TTable`, the `__builtin_table_*` templates in `aot.h`, and the rehash a grow performs on every
stored non-string key (a string table reuses its stored hashes): it takes the workhorse detour
for a handled type and hashes a builtin type as itself, telling them apart by
`WrapsBuiltinValue` (`cast.h`, beside `WrapType`'s primary; a translation unit that sees the
vec4f detour from `jit_abi.h` sees the marks too, and one that sees neither hashes raw either way). The detour on a
builtin vector or range would hash a `vec4f`'s 16 bytes against the node's 8 or 12, and the raw
bytes of a handled type narrower than its workhorse (an 8-byte `ImVec2` wrapped to `vec4f`)
would miss the node's 16; either way every such key moves to another bucket at the first grow.
Non-string tables are open-addressed from their first slot (only string keys pack linearly up
to 8), so a disagreement shows on a one-key table as much as on a large one.

`KeyCompare` (`runtime_table.h`) answers the other half of a lookup, and it compares the bytes
`KeyHash` hashed: `KeyCompare<vec4f>` is a bit compare, `v_cmp_eqi`. It takes the workhorse
detour for every key type whose `WrapType` names one, builtin vector and handled type alike, and
unlike the hash it has no width to get wrong - both sides widen through the same
`prune<vec4f, PT>`, which zero-fills the padding on every one of its paths. What it must not do
is compare as float, because an integer key's bytes are not a float: every `int2` component in
[-8388607, -1] spells a NaN, NaN is not equal to itself, and such a key therefore inserts (nothing
compares equal, so nothing dedups) and is then unreachable to every lookup, `key_exists` and
erase, on any platform. Bytes small in magnitude spell denormals, which a host built with FTZ/DAZ
reads as zero, so two such keys merge wherever they meet in the probe sequence. A float key pays
for the bit compare with the `0.0 == -0.0` tie, which its two distinct hashes never honoured
anyway. `tests/language/table_vector_keys.das` covers both patterns.

## Function and global lookup

A `Context` finds a function or a global by mangled-name hash and by plain name through one
object each, `functionLookup` and `variableLookup` (`name_lookup.h`, shared between a context and
its forks and clones the way the functions array is). A simulated program builds them:
`Program::buildMNLookup` / `buildGMNLookup` insert every entry and seal once, and the sealed blob is
owned by the object and freed with it. A standalone exe and a standalone AOT context adopt them:
the emitter (`modules/dasLLVM/daslib/llvm_exe.das` and `daslib/aot_standalone.das`, repo root)
builds the same object at code-generation time through the `name_lookup_*` builtins of the
`rtti_core` module, writes the sealed arrays into the artifact as constant data in the word layout
the header pins, and the generated constructor hands that `StaticTable` to `adopt` - nothing is
built or allocated at startup and the object owns nothing. The standalone C++ constructor also
verifies every global's runtime offset against the emitted table, since the emitter computes those
offsets with `InitGlobalVariable`'s rule rather than reading them back. An insert or an adopt after
the seal stops the program, and a seal that finds two entries on one mangled-name hash, or two
different names on one name hash, fails and names both entries - the same footing the runtime
already gives every 64-bit string hash.

The seal builds two perfect hashes (compress-hash-displace over the distinct keys, five keys per
bucket, five percent empty slots), so a lookup is one probe and one 64-bit compare with no
collision chain: `fnByMangledName` and `globalOffsetByMangledName` - the latter on the hot path of
every global access by hash in all three tiers - read one entry, and a by-name lookup hashes the
string, reads one slot, and walks the same-name chain the seal linked in function-index order.
`findFunction(name, isUnique)` answers from the head's link, `findFunctions` is the walk, and a
missing key of either kind answers `NOT_FOUND` / `-1` without touching a name string. The
entry's `value` is what the hash probe hands back - a function index, a global's byte offset -
and `index` is the position in `functions` / `globalVariables`, which is what the by-name API
returns. Measured against `das_hash_map` on 8 000 keys the hash probe is 2.2 ns against 5.8 and
the by-name probe 25 ns against 41, in one eighth and one half the memory; sealing both hashes
for 8 000 entries takes single-digit milliseconds, paid once per `Program::simulate` and never at
the startup of an artifact that adopts. A fresh object, and one whose seal failed, points at a
static empty table and answers every probe with a miss, so a context that never simulated, a
compile that failed at the seal, and a standalone exe between its creation and its adopt all
answer `NOT_FOUND` rather than reading through a null pointer.

## Sanctioned hot-path additions

The ledger the checklist's hot-path rules route to. Each entry: what was added, where, why
correctness required it, and the alternative that was rejected.

- **`SetMod` on `SimPolicy_IntBin`** (`sim_policy.h`) - one compare-and-branch on the
  `a == INTMIN && b == -1` pair, matching the guard `Div`, `SetDiv` and `Mod` on the same
  template already carry. Correctness required it because x86 `idiv` faults on that pair
  rather than wrapping: without the override `SimPolicy_Int64` inherited
  `SimPolicy_Bin::SetMod`, whose only guard is `b == 0`, so `LONG_MIN %= -1` killed the
  process with SIGFPE in every build, and `INT_MIN %= -1` did the same wherever
  `DAS_FAST_INTEGER_MOD` is 0 - which `platform.h` sets for any host built `-ffast-math`.
  Rejected alternative: giving `SimPolicy_Int64` the double-division form `SimPolicy_Int`
  uses under `DAS_FAST_INTEGER_MOD`, which cannot hold an int64 exactly and is the reason
  that path is already disabled under relaxed math.

- **CRT scalar transcendentals** (`sim_policy.h`) - the scalar float arms of `Exp`, `Exp2`,
  `Log2` and `Pow` call the CRT; the `vec4f` arms stay on the vecmath polynomials, where
  four lanes amortize the setup. The lane trick's `v_set_x`/`v_extract_x` round-trip is a
  partial-register dependency chain scalar codegen does not break, so for these arms the
  CRT call is cheaper than the inlined polynomial - that is the rejected alternative. `Log2`
  is the one arm the swap does not speed up: it trades the `v_log2_est_p5` estimate for the
  exact answer the JIT already computes, so interp, AOT and JIT agree. `log`, `sin`, `cos`
  and `tan` stay on the lane, which is cheaper for them. The measurements behind the split:
  `plans/benchmark_followups.md` (repo root), the scalar-exp section.

- **`das_ordered2`** (`aot.h`) - a two-member aggregate the AOT emitter wraps around any
  binary op whose operands are not both side-effect-free, because braced aggregate init is
  the C++ construct that guarantees left-to-right evaluation; a plain call argument list or
  binary operator is unsequenced, and the interpreter and JIT both evaluate left-then-right.
  Optimized builds flatten the wrapper to nothing; an unoptimized AOT build pays a copy of
  both operand values
  plus an immediately-invoked lambda frame per wrapped op. Ops whose policy operands need a
  ref cast decline the wrapper and keep the plain unordered emission. Rejected alternative:
  hoisting operands to named temporaries in the emitter, which needs statement-position
  rewriting the textual visitor cannot do inside an expression.

- **Member `fn` on the extern-call nodes** (`interop.h`: `SimNode_ExtFuncCall`,
  `SimNode_ExtFuncCallAndCopyOrMove`, `SimNode_ExtFuncCallRef`) - the function pointer is
  a runtime member so all binds of one signature share a single node instantiation, which
  is what shrinks module binaries (bind-heavy shared modules measure -5..-24%) and halves
  per-bind compile time. Cost per evaluated extern call: one member load plus an indirect
  call in place of a direct, potentially inlined one - measured at 3-4.5% on loops that
  are nothing but extern calls, noise on real programs (dasProfile lane medians >=1.00).
  Binds that need the old profile opt into the NTTP flavor (`addExternInline` ->
  `SimNode_ExtFuncCallInline`; the modules `src/builtin/REVIEW.md` names bind that
  way by policy). The cmres and ref flavors have no NTTP twin yet, so those
  binds pay the indirect call unconditionally. Cross-slot and lattice typed reads route
  through the base as `cast<Carrier>::to(this->eval(ctx))` - a second virtual dispatch
  plus a vec4f round-trip on paths that are rare by construction (the compiler emits the
  matching slot; only uint-index reads and value reinterpret land here). Rejected
  alternative: keeping the per-function NTTP matrix everywhere - master's shape, ~24KB of
  object code and ~11ms of compile per bind, mostly duplicated typed-eval stubs.

- **Typed evals on the function-address const nodes** (`simulate_nodes.h`:
  `SimNode_FuncConstValue`, `SimNode_FuncConstValueMnh`) - `evalPtr`, `evalInt64` and
  `evalUInt64` route through the base as `cast<CTYPE>::to(eval(context))`, a second virtual
  dispatch plus a vec4f round-trip. Correctness requires them because without them those
  three slots assert and return 0, which in a build with `DAS_NO_ASSERTIONS` is a silent null:
  `reinterpret<uint64>(@@fn)` written on the address-of expression is typed uint64, so every
  store of it - a local, a field, an array element, an arithmetic operand, a return - reads the
  uint64 slot, while JIT and AOT already answer the address. The slots widen by value:
  `cast<SimFunction *>::from` fills a whole vec4f, so a 32-bit host reads the pointer
  zero-extended. The same cast on a `function` parameter or local is a different path:
  `reinterpret` relabels memory at the target's width, and on a 32-bit host that reads four
  bytes past a 4-byte slot. The inliner turns a parameter into exactly such a local. The
  portable handle spelling is `intptr`, which switches on `sizeof`. Rejected alternative:
  rejecting the cast during inference, which would break the reverse spelling and the two
  tiers that already answer correctly.
