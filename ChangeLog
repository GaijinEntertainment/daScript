  * Fixed: Freeing a normalized URI like "http://test?"
      caused a crash. Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Filename <--> URI string conversion helpers can
      now handle relative URIs and filenames
  * Changed: Soname set to 1:2:0

2007-12-23 -- 0.6.1

  * Fixed: Percent-encodings in hostnames were not repaired during normalization.
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Percent-encodings were fixed after dot removal not before during
      normalization.
      Thanks to Adrian Manrique for reporting!
  * Fixed: Include path order bug
      Thanks to Ed Schouten for reporting this!
  * Fixed: Shadow builds now possible
      Thanks to Adeodato Simó for the patch!
  * Added: Version guards for Autoconf/Automake
      Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for reporting!
  * Changed: Soname set to 1:1:0

2007-09-17 -- 0.6.0

  * Fixed: Proper soname updates from now on, starting at 1:0:0
  * Removed: Visual Studio 2003 project files

2007-09-13 -- 0.5.2

  * Added: RemoveBaseUri function to create URI references
  * Added: Unix/Windows filename <--> URI string conversion helpers
  * Added: EscapeEx function to escape text blocks without zero termination
  * Fixed: Bug in ToString for URIs with scheme, path, but no host (e.g. "f:/.//g")
  * Fixed: AddBase now resolves ".//g" with base "f:/a" to "f:/.//g" instead of
      "f://g" which would result in "g" becoming the authority part when parsing
      a recomposition (ToString) of that URI structure. This is a whole in RFC 3986,
      see http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/uri/2007Aug/0003.html for details.

2007-08-09 -- 0.5.1

  * Fixed: Empty host bug (URIs like "///g")
  * Fixed: Relative URIs are no longer touched by normalization
  * Fixed: MergePath failed for empty paths
  * Fixed: Bug with "." segments in AddBase
      All of the above revealed by test cases from 4Suite (http://4suite.org/)

2007-07-28 -- 0.5.0

  * Added: Syntax-based normalization
  * Added: Percent-encoding function Escape
  * Improved: Malloc/NULL checks added
  * Added: New function UnescapeInPlaceEx can also decode '+' to ' '
      and convert line breaks
  * Added: Exact space computation for ToString, see ToStringCharsRequired
  * Added: --enable-sizedown for saving space and slower code
  * Fixed: Two internal functions were exposed in the API by mistake:
      uriPushToStack and uriStackToOctet
  * Added: Visual Studio 2005 project files
  * Removed: Legacy code (removal was announced for 0.5.0)

2007-07-06 -- 0.4.1

  * Fixed: ToString did not work for IPv4 and IPv6 hosts

2007-07-03 -- 0.4.0

  * Added: References resolution (think relative to absolute)
  * Added: Naive URI equality check
  * Added: URIs can now be converted back to strings
  * Fixed: The first path segment of a relative URI was eaten
      (functions ParseSegmentNz and ParseMustBeSegmentNzNc)
  * Fixed: uri->scheme.first was not reset in some cases
      (function ParseMustBeSegmentNzNc)
  * Improved: Test suite now built on "make check", not before
  * Fixed: Test suite always returned 0 (success)

2007-04-23 -- 0.3.4
