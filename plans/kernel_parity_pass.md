# Kernel parity pass - CPU and Vulkan kernels to same-speed-or-better

The arc after PR #3915 (the iquant format ladder). The bar is Boris's: **parity is >= 1.0x of
llama.cpp on the row; 0.95x is a gap.** The method is the compile-profile loop below - never a
model load, a mint, or a 48 s JIT re-emit per try.

Branch `bbatkin/kernel-parity`, stacked on the PR-1 tip; rebases onto master after that merge.

## 1. The procedure - three rigs, inner to outer

1. **Inner loop: the kernel microbench, seconds per try, no model.**
   `modules/dasLLAMA/benchmarks/matmul/kq_kernel_bench.das` - raw kernels, one thread, synthetic
   planes, every row of a kernel's `_variants()` registry timed. Under `DAS_TUNE_MODE=tune` that is
   the whole `[tune_perm]` grid (gemv and tile, since the gemv is the tile's `tune_companion`);
   under normal mode the stamped winner alone. `--perm <substr>` narrows the race (on zen2 the two
   VNNI seats decline and run the reference body - visible as reference-speed rows). Timing only:
   a spelling's correctness is `DAS_TUNE_MODE=test harness/gen_tune_probe.das`.
   ```
   DAS_TUNE_MODE=tune bin/Release/daslang.exe -jit modules/dasLLAMA/benchmarks/matmul/kq_kernel_bench.das -- --fmt iq3s --perm maddubs --ntok 0
   ```
2. **The reference row, isolated the same way.** llama.cpp's `test-backend-ops perf -o MUL_MAT`
   times one mul_mat per quant type; its default case is m=4096 rows, k=14336, n in
   {1,2,3,4,5,8,512} tokens - the microbench's default shape. Thread parity through the
   `GGML_BENCH_THREADS` define the harness patch carries (re-applied by hand at the reference tip
   6c84c7d5d; `harness/backend_ops_shapes.patch` no longer applies there):
   ```
   GGML_BENCH_THREADS=1 D:/Work/llama.cpp/build-clean-cpu/bin/Release/test-backend-ops.exe perf -b CPU -o MUL_MAT -p "type_a=iq3_s,type_b=f32,m=4096,n=1,"
   D:/Work/llama.cpp/build-vulkan/bin/Release/test-backend-ops.exe perf -b Vulkan0 -o MUL_MAT -p "type_a=q4_K"
   ```
   Vulkan has the same rig on our side in `harness/vk_gemm_probe.das` (`ref` arm = llama.cpp's own
   coopmat2 SPV blob inside our harness; `k6x flat` = compose without scale reads).
3. **Outer loop: the app, only when a spelling wins rig 1.** `-jit -module-cache
   .jitted_scripts/module_cache/<app>.dascache <app>.das -- --jit-split-modules=-1` (5 s warm,
   65 s after a kernel edit); `--tune-only <family>` re-crowns one family; `DAS_TUNE_POLICY=reference`
   is the A/B baseline. The stock monolith invocation runs once per landed kernel for the table
   row. `rm -rf .jitted_scripts` after an emitter edit (`dasllama_gemm_gen.das`) - QUIRK 21.

Rules that ride along: bench at `DAS_JOBQUE_THREADS=16`, tests at 8; one row at a time; one
proven fact per push; research before any kernel edit (the two memos below).

## 2. The fact base (zen2 3990X, one thread, m=4096 k=14336, us per run; ours = `dot_maddubs_width256_mr8`)

| format | ours gemv | llama.cpp n=1 | ours/theirs | ours tile n=512 | llama.cpp n=512 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| k4 | 1969 (8.6 ns/sb) | 2421 | 1.23x | 120.9 GFLOP/s | 71.1 GFLOP/s (1.70x) |
| k2 | 2017 (8.8 ns/sb) | 2132 | 1.06x | - | - |
| iq3s | 11406 (49.7 ns/sb); sign=vec 7562 (33.0) | 10340 | 0.91x -> 1.37x | - | - |
| iq3xxs | 11578 (50.5); sign=vec 7893 (34.4) | 6590 | 0.57x -> 0.83x | - | - |
| iq2s | 11732 (51.1); sign=vec + u64 pair 5152 (22.5) | 5074 | 0.43x -> 0.98x | - | - |
| iq2xs | 11490 (50.1); sign=vec + u64 pair 6297 (27.5) | 5386 | 0.47x -> 0.86x | - | - |
| iq2xxs | 11061 (48.2); sign=vec + u64 pair 5209 (22.7) | 5124 | 0.46x -> 0.98x | - | - |

Reading: the five grid formats cost 48-51 ns per superblock regardless of what each decodes,
against 8.6-8.8 for k4/k2. A flat cost independent of the format is a shared mechanism, not five
decode problems. The model-level tg rows (0.70-0.92x) are this 2x kernel gap hidden behind memory
bandwidth; on the 1B vehicles it shows, on a 27B it mostly does not - but the kernel is the same.

## 3. Research memos (read before touching the kernels)

- `kernel_parity_research_cpu.md` - llama.cpp's CPU vec_dot for the five grid formats + Q2_K,
  x86 and arm64, against our emitter arms. Headline: every one of our five gathers ends each
  decoded dword with a 4-byte store into `te.iq3s_panel` and reloads 32 bytes spanning eight such
  stores - a wide load over narrow stores, which x86 does not forward. llama.cpp composes grid
  words into registers on both arches. The signs-on-activation half of followup 61 does not port
  to our 8-rows-per-vector layout; llama.cpp's arm64 arms put signs on the weights for the same
  reason. Ranked spellings: (1) `gather="reg"` - group-major compose, `insertelement` per row,
  no panel; (2) `psign="mask"` - a vector sign mask instead of GPR sign math + `llvm.abs`;
  (3) a `vpdpbssd` seat (AVX-VNNI-INT8 hosts, no generator change); (4) repack-baked parity sign
  byte (free for IQ2_XXS/IQ3_XXS). Incidental waste: IQ2_XXS reads its aux word as four i8 loads
  + shifts where IQ3_XXS uses one i32 load; IQ2_XS builds a u16 from two i8 loads.
- `kernel_parity_research_vk.md` - llama.cpp's cm2 `mul_mm` against our cm2 tile. Headline: the
  same kernel design (tile geometry, workgroup, decode-in-load callback, one coopMatMulAdd per
  k-step, zero barriers in the k loop, the same split-k heuristic) - the gap is not the tile.
  Real differences: llama.cpp hoists Q4_K/Q5_K scales into shared memory as ready `(d,m)` pairs
  (`shAscales`), ours re-extracts from a second SSBO with a variable shift per decoded element;
  its scales sit in the quant block, ours in a separate plane. Ranked: (1) split the end-to-end
  pp512 budget first - `GGML_VK_PERF_LOGGER=1` per-shape MUL_MAT rows against our `pfq_ts` roles
  decides whether the GEMM is even the gap (367 barriers per window in the chain); (2) the scale
  hoist (10-20% on k4/k5); (3) interleave the scale plane into the quant block; (4) pad N to the
  tile width; then narrow-tail accumulator, unroll, vec4 decode. Corrections: followup_vulkan 34's
  "same band" (it is 0.67-0.90x), "shared tier not decode" (Q8 rows sit at 1.00x+), and "tg holds
  parity" (IQ2_XS 0.54x) are stale. glslc here lacks NV_cooperative_matrix_decode_vector, so
  llama.cpp runs its scalar decode too - apples to apples today, and its vec4 twin is a widening
  waiting to happen.

## 4. Work queue (one item at a time; a row is done at >= 1.0x on rig 2's shape AND the vehicle)

CPU decode (gap 2):
1. DONE-KILLED `gather="reg"` (measured 1.85x slower - see the ledger).
2. DONE all five: `sign="vec"` - the sign-byte column negates whole vectors; iq3s/iq2s load it
   off the plane, iq3xxs/iq2xs/iq2xxs synthesize it from the 7-bit codes (parity = the 8th bit),
   so no plane layout change (the repack-baked byte was killed by the plane map: grp bytes are the
   disk bytes, ~30 CPU/Vulkan/Metal sites read them).
3. DONE: the iq2 formats' u64 grid pair as one 8-byte load, half split in registers.
4. OPEN: the tuner cannot crown a gemv-only spelling - it races the TILE, where sign=vec is inert
   (--tune-only iq3sq8_tile_gen crowned the old seat by a tie). Decision pending the M1 numbers:
   make sign=vec THE gemv path (delete the knob and its 20 seats) if it wins on ARM too.
5. iq2xs 0.86x / iq3xxs 0.83x residue: the per-dword qs byte loads (a 4-byte column load with
   in-register byte extraction is the next candidate); the u16 single load for iq2xs measured
   SLOWER (6991 vs 6306 us) and was dropped. 6. retro audit of IQ4_XS/Q3_K per followup 60.

Vulkan pp (gap 1):
1. Budget split (measurement, no kernel edit) - is the GEMM the 30%? 2. `shAscales`-style scale
   hoist; 3. scale plane interleave; 4. N padding; 5+. the rest of the memo's list.

Vulkan grid tg (gap 3): followup_vulkan 35's levers, after gap 1 or 2 lands.

## 5. Ledger

- 2026-09-01: CPU item 1 measured and killed - `gather="reg"` (compose the weight vector with
  insertelement, no panel) ran iq3s decode at 90.6 ns/sb against the panel's 49.1; the emitted IR
  had 1025 insertelement chains and a 9904-instruction straight-line body against the panel loop's
  1893 (every load unique, so CSE was not the problem). The panel round trip is not the bottleneck.
- 2026-09-01: CPU item 2 landed as `sign="vec"` on iq3s and iq2s, the two formats whose sign bytes
  sit in the plane at row stride 4: the panel holds raw grid words, one 32-byte column load per
  block, a constant shuffle + and + cmpeq builds the byte mask, xor + sub negates the vector.
  One thread, m=4096 k=14336: iq3s 11581 -> 7732 us (1.34x of the reference's 10340), iq2s 12413
  -> 7076 us (0.72x of 5074, was 0.41x). Every variant bit-exact in gen_tune_probe TEST mode. The
  five gather emitters collapsed into one gather over per-format decode functions (-110 lines).
- 2026-09-01: sign=vec for iq3xxs/iq2xs/iq2xxs via the parity-synthesized column (no layout
  change) and the u64 grid pair load for the three iq2 formats: iq2s 5152 us (0.98x), iq2xxs 5209
  (0.98x), iq2xs 6297 (0.86x), iq3xxs 7893 (0.83x), iq3s 7562 (1.37x); 85 variants ok in TEST mode.
- 2026-09-01: step 0 done - `kq_kernel_bench.das`, the reference rows, both memos, the fact base
  above. `test-backend-ops` built in `build-clean-cpu` and `build-vulkan` with the thread pin.
