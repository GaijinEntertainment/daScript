# Utils Code Review Checklist

**Read `REVIEW_COMMON.md` (repo root) first - its contract binds this checklist.** Architecture
doc: `CLAUDE.md` (repo root).

A tool is a directory holding a program and the files only that program uses. A directory is
a tool when `CMakeLists.txt` (beside this file) or the repo root's `CMakeLists.txt` builds or
ships a program it holds, or when `CMakeLists.txt` (beside this file) runs a `DAS_UTILS_TO_TEST`
suite against such a program, wherever that directory sits; a directory under `utils/` is also
a tool when its `.das_package` declares a program with `release_main` (its own) or
`release_program` (a companion), or when a CMake target or a `.github/workflows/` step (repo
root) names in its command a program it holds. A directory holds a program when the program's
entry file sits in it - or sits in a child folder of it, when the directory itself holds a
`README.md`. A change under `common/` (beside this file) is a change to every tool that requires
it.

A tool is shipped when an `install(...)` rule in `CMakeLists.txt` (beside this file) or the
repo root's `CMakeLists.txt` puts its program in the bundle - a built executable
(`install(PROGRAMS ...)` for a `DAS_UTILS_SHIPPED_EXES` entry, `install(TARGETS ...)` for a
C++ target), or the entry file copied as source (`install(FILES ...)` or
`install(DIRECTORY ...)`).

An arm is one test case that a test runner executes and reports pass or fail for on its own,
in any language: a `dastest` `[test]` function and each `t |> run(...)` case inside that
function are arms, and so is each `test(...)` case of a JavaScript runner (`node:test`,
Playwright). An arm's load-bearing assertions are the ones that prove the change, never a
skip-path assertion.

A CI row is a workflow step whose command runs the arm, directly or through a process it
spawns. An assertion no CI row can run is one where either no CI row runs the arm, or the arm
returns or skips before the assertion. An arm that skips unless a host tool is present has
assertions a CI row can run when the pull-request lane's runner image carries that tool, and
the change names that lane. One arm can hold assertions of both kinds.

**A changed file that belongs to a tool, wherever the tool sits, is reviewed with that tool's
own `REVIEW.md`, where one exists, as well as with this checklist.**

**A diff that adds a `[test]` file covering a change to a tool puts that file under the tool's
directory; a test covering a change under `common/` goes under `common/`, and a test covering
two tools goes under either one.**

**A diff that changes how a tool builds a `.dlim` from a gguf, how one loads it, or what
identifies one - the fields that decide whether two `.dlim`s are the same image - answers to
`modules/dasLLAMA/REVIEW.md` (repo root) too.**

**A file that belongs to a tool and carries `options _dasllama_internal`, wherever the diff
puts it, applies `modules/dasLLAMA/REVIEW.md` (repo root) too.**

**Weakening `REVIEW.das` (beside this file) is a defect: dropping a check, narrowing what a check
walks, or rewriting a finding text so it no longer names what failed.**

**A diff that drops a tool from `DAS_UTILS_SHIPPED_EXES` (`CMakeLists.txt`, beside this file)
while keeping that tool's directory records the decision to stop shipping it in that tool's
own `README.md`, wherever that directory is, in the same change** - `REVIEW.das` cannot see a
removed entry, and it reads each shipped tool's `README.md` for the standing decision.

**A diff that deletes a tool named in `DAS_UTILS_SHIPPED_EXES` leaves a comment line beside
the list naming the removed exe, in the same change.**

**An arm the diff adds or changes that covers a change to a tool, whose load-bearing
assertions a CI row can run against the change, ships with a CI row that executes those
assertions on every pull request, wherever the diff puts the arm, added in the same change
when no row does that yet.** A row that only compile-checks the arm (`dastest --compile-only`)
does not execute them.

**An arm the diff adds or changes that covers a change to a tool, whose load-bearing
assertions no CI row can run, ships with a row that compile-checks the file the arm sits in -
`dastest --compile-only` - added in the same change if no row already compile-checks that
file.**

**An arm the diff adds or changes that covers a change to a tool, whose load-bearing
assertions no CI row can run, records in the PR description an executed run against the build
the diff produces - the machine the assertions ran on, why no CI row can run them, and the pass
count - or cites the log of a workflow run on this diff's branch showing those assertions ran.**
A run against an already-deployed artifact proves nothing about the diff under review.

**A diff that adds or renames a key in a `watchdog.json` that belongs to a tool, wherever the
tool sits, names a `WatchdogConfig` field in `watchdog/watchdog.das`, in the same change** -
the supervisor refuses to start on an unknown key.

**A diff that adds a front to a shipped tool adds a `run_check` row starting that front to
`ci/smoke_test_bundle.sh` (repo root), in the same change.** A front is a command-line mode
that makes a program serve a different role or protocol. The bundle gate proves only the
fronts it starts.
